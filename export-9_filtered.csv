Geographic Extent: Partial coverage of six counties in New Hampshire and Maine, covering approximately 3,276 total square miles. Dataset Description: The Umbagog NH/ME 2016 LiDAR project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters for the New Hampshire, Maine, and FEMA R1 (MOD1) areas of interest.

LiDAR data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files formatted to 11,133 individual 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter tiles, 63 individual 750-meter x 750-meter tiles, and 36 individual 500-meter x 500-meter tiles, as tiled intensity imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter schema. Continuous hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in the spring and fall of 2017, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. established a total of 181 ground control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 301 independent accuracy checkpoints, 178 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (178 NVA points), 123 in Forested, Shrubs, and Tall Weeds categories (123 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.

This land cover map was refined to the State of Maine requirements using SPOT 5 panchromatic imagery from 2004. The Landsat imagery used was for three seasons: early spring (leaf-off), summer, and early fall (senescence) and was collected with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The SPOT 5 panchromatic imagery was collected at a spatial resolution of 5 m during the spring and summer months of 2004. The map was developed in two distinct stages, the first stage was the development of a state wide land cover data set consistent with the NOAAC-CAP land cover map.

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y). Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. The naming convention is based on the U. S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. Task Order Number G09PD01896. USGS Contract Number 07CRCN0014.

Camera sensors calibration reports are included in the project report. Calibration flights are flown regularly. Natural color orthoimagery is organized in three color bands or channels which represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) portions of the spectrum.

These data were derived by starting with a conventional habitat classification strategy, with classes constructed using combined physical factors-depth, seabed form, and substrate type. Biological data was then overlaid and analyzed using a quantitative cluster analysis to identify distinct species groups, followed by classification and regression tree analysis to identify the threshold values for each physical factor that best predict occurrences for all species groups. Finally, GIS analysis methods were used to produce data which are the three-way combination of depth, sediment grain size and seabed form based on the ecological thresholds revealed by the organism relationships. The thresholds used for depth, grain size and seabed form to define the benthic habitats were extracted directly from the organism data. This step was critical in ensuring that the benthic habitats represent truly different environments as perceived by the benthic macrofauna. Development of these data was made possible by access to over forty years of data from the unparalleled sampling effort of the Northeast's benthic invertebrate fauna by NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS): Northeast Fisheries Science Center. Primary data sources on physical factors were a comprehensive bathymetry grid from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center and substrate data from usSEABED, a collaborative product of the USGS and other partners.",https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_OceanEcology/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,8,geology

Saudi/GraceSaudi,https://www.esrs.wmich.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Saudi/GraceSaudi/MapServer,Map Service,"Michigan,Western Michigan University - Geology and Earth Sciences,EnergyAtlas,Saudi","The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission was launched in March 2002 to map the temporal variations in the Earth’s global gravity field on a monthly basis. The variability in these gravity field solutions represents geophysical responses associated with redistribution of mass at or near the Earth’s surface, where mass variations are likely to occur on the time scales examined by GRACE measurements. Generally, the largest time-variable gravity signals observable in GRACE data are expected to come from changes in the distribution of water and snow stored on land. <BR><BR>This project aims at utilizing temporal GRACE, TRMM, and Land Surface Model data to identify areas undergoing mass variations and investigating the factors controlling these variations. This was accomplished by examination and correlation of observations from temporal mass (GRACE data), precipitation (from TRMM) data, and Land Surface Model outputs with relevant geologic, hydrologeologic, topographic (DEMs), derived data (e.g., stream networks from digital topography) in a GIS environment. <BR><BR>Our findings revealed: (1) central and northern sections of the MAS are experiencing high groundwater depletion rates (-4.2±1.1 mm/yr) and are currently over exploited, yet sustainable extraction could be achieved by reducing annual extraction by 2.4 km3, and (2) southern sections of the MAS (Rub Al Khali Aquifer System; RAKAS) are experiencing low groundwater depletion rates (eastern RAKAS: -1.6±0.4 mm/yr) to steady-state conditions (western RAKAS: 0.3±0.7 mm/yr). The first activity of the project entailed training of the SGS researchers. Following the training, the SGS and WMU scientists worked jointly on every task of this project. An article summarizing our collective findings is being considered for publication in the GSA Bulletin.<BR>",https://www.esrs.wmich.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Saudi/GraceSaudi/MapServer/info/thumbnail,oil,8,oil
