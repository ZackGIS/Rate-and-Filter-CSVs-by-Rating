The SPOT 5 panchromatic imagery was collected at a spatial resolution of 5 m during the spring and summer months of 2004. The map was developed in two distinct stages, the first stage was the development of a state wide land cover data set consistent with the NOAAC-CAP land cover map. The second stage was: a) the update to 2004 conditions, b) a refinement of the classification system to Maine specific classes and, c) a refinement of the spatial boundaries to create a polygon map based on 5 m imagery.",https://gis.maine.gov/arcgis/rest/services/imageryBaseMapsEarthCover/earthCoverMelcd/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery and basemaps,8,basemaps

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) contributed toward this project via a separate funding agreement with USGS. The completed orthorectified files represent quarter-quarter-quadrangle (QQQ) sized tiles with a 300m over-edge. All overedges for ORTHO_1F also overlap adjacent ORTHO_HF and ORTHO_2F orthophotography by this distance. ORTHO_1F tiles provide complete coverage of the TIER A boundaries as defined by the Towns designated TIER A will have complete coverage by 1 foot GSD imagery.</span></p></div></div></div>",https://gis.maine.gov/arcgis/rest/services/imageryBaseMapsEarthCover/orthoRegional1Foot2003to2005/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery for energy infrastructure mapping,7,imagery

The goal of this program is to spatially map and quantify the biophysical (ecological) and economic value of ecosystem services provided by forest and wetland areas across the state of Maryland. Ecosystem services included in this analysis are atmospheric pollution removal (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter 10, particulate matter 2.5, and sulfur dioxide), carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, nitrogen removal, flood prevention and stormwater mitigation, wildlife habitat and biodiversity, and surface water protection. This map service includes 24 layers, which provide 30 meter resolution raster maps of the biophysical and economic value of each individual ecosystem service, as well as a layer providing the total economic value of all ecosystem services considered in this analysis. The total economic value of ecosystem services provided by forest and wetland areas across Maryland is over $8.02 billion yearly.<BR><BR>For more information regarding ecosystem services, please visit: http://dnr.maryland.gov/ccs/Pages/Ecosystem-Services.aspx<BR><BR>For more detailed information regarding the input data and methods used to create this ecosystem service dataset, please visit: http://dnr.maryland.gov/ccs/Documents/AMESreportFinal_MDDNR.pdf<BR><BR> ***Note: Ecosystem service dollar value does not equate to a Fair Market appraisal.",https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_EcosystemServices/MapServer/info/thumbnail,environmental,8,environmental

Saudi/GraceSaudi,https://www.esrs.wmich.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Saudi/GraceSaudi/MapServer,Map Service,"Michigan,Western Michigan University - Geology and Earth Sciences,EnergyAtlas,Saudi","The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission was launched in March 2002 to map the temporal variations in the Earth’s global gravity field on a monthly basis. The variability in these gravity field solutions represents geophysical responses associated with redistribution of mass at or near the Earth’s surface, where mass variations are likely to occur on the time scales examined by GRACE measurements. Generally, the largest time-variable gravity signals observable in GRACE data are expected to come from changes in the distribution of water and snow stored on land. <BR><BR>This project aims at utilizing temporal GRACE, TRMM, and Land Surface Model data to identify areas undergoing mass variations and investigating the factors controlling these variations. This was accomplished by examination and correlation of observations from temporal mass (GRACE data), precipitation (from TRMM) data, and Land Surface Model outputs with relevant geologic, hydrologeologic, topographic (DEMs), derived data (e.g., stream networks from digital topography) in a GIS environment. <BR><BR>Our findings revealed: (1) central and northern sections of the MAS are experiencing high groundwater depletion rates (-4.2±1.1 mm/yr) and are currently over exploited, yet sustainable extraction could be achieved by reducing annual extraction by 2.4 km3, and (2) southern sections of the MAS (Rub Al Khali Aquifer System; RAKAS) are experiencing low groundwater depletion rates (eastern RAKAS: -1.6±0.4 mm/yr) to steady-state conditions (western RAKAS: 0.3±0.7 mm/yr). The first activity of the project entailed training of the SGS researchers. Following the training, the SGS and WMU scientists worked jointly on every task of this project. An article summarizing our collective findings is being considered for publication in the GSA Bulletin.<BR>",https://www.esrs.wmich.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Saudi/GraceSaudi/MapServer/info/thumbnail,oil,10,oil
