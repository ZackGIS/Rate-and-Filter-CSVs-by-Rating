In addition to providing habitat for multiple Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) (Vermont Wildlife Action Plan Team, 2015), they provide and recharge drinking water sources. Wetlands, river corridors, floodplain forests, and riparian forests are also an important water resource as they help to filter out and attenuate sediments, excess nutrients, and other contaminants damaging to water quality and habitat. Taken in concert with Vermont’s priority forest blocks—see the Forest Block, Connectivity, and Resiliency Resources—the interconnected network of large forest blocks, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and riparian corridors allow for movement of wildlife and plants across the landscape, as well as continuity of other ecological processes critical to Vermont’s waterways and biodiversity (Sorenson and Zaino, 2018).<BR><BR>References<BR>Vermont Wildlife Action Plan Team. 2015.
