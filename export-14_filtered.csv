Geographic Extent: 13 counties in Pennsylvania, covering approximately 6,602 total square miles. Dataset Description: The South Central Pennsylvania 2017 QL2 LiDAR project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD 1983 (2011), UTM Zone 18, meters and vertical datum of NAVD 1988 (GEOID 12B), meters. LiDAR data were delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files formatted to 7,975 individual 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter tiles, as tiled intensity imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter schema. Continuous breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in fall 2017, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 150 ground control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 245 independent accuracy checkpoints, 142 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (142 NVA points), 103 in Tall Weeds categories (103 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.

Coordinated by the USGS with representatives from each of the participating states, this work sought to collect seamless LiDAR data for all of the coastal counties between New York and Maine. With accuracies 25 – 100 times better than what is currently available for much of Rhode Island, a contiguous and consistent elevation dataset derived from this new data collection initiative will facilitate a number of statewide applications including transportation planning, floodplain mapping, and hazard mitigation.

As part of this work, the 2011 USGS-delivered LAS data was subset to extract just the bare earth elevation points. These were reprojected to the RI State plane coordinate system, and horizontal/vertical units were converted to feet.

It evolved from a GIS overlay analysis of land suitability and availability and scenario planning for future growth. The analysis focused on the 37% of the State identified as undeveloped and unprotected in a land cover analysis from RIGIS 1995 land use land cover data. The project studied areas for suitability for conservation and development, based on the location of key natural resources and public infrastructure. The results identified areas with future use potential, under three categories of development intensity and two categories of conservation.

This model uses a 2011 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) where water level rises based on the surrounding topography, and a tidal surface model (VDatum) which adjusts the water levels for tidal differences at different points in Rhode Island; for example at the top and the bottom of Narragansett Bay. To be consistent with other projects on SLR in Rhode Island, we have selected three scenarios to map: 1 foot of SLR, 3 feet of SLR, and 5 feet of SLR. The SLR scenarios add 1, 3, or 5 feet on top of the average daily high tide; also referred to as Mean Higher High Water (MHHW). <BR>Rhode Island faces sea level rise (SLR), an increasing number of extreme weather events, rising tides, and warmer temperatures due to climate change. These changes will affect our state’s transportation network, and the more proactive we can be about identifying vulnerabilities, the greater chance we have to make wise decisions about our investments in transportation infrastructure. <BR>The SLR inundation data was enhanced by the Statewide Planning Program through careful review of areas with uncertain hydrological connections and areas disconnected by a dam's height. Ortho and oblique aerial imagery was viewed, along with the RIGIS streams and dams dataset, to determine whether there was a possible hydrological connection or disconnect from coastal water SLR. There are some areas hydrological connections are uncertain. These areas were reviewed to the maximum extent possible given project constraints. Areas where there is an uncertain hydrological connection can be found in the 'SLR_Uncertain_RIDOP' dataset also available on RIGIS. Note that SLR is distinct from storm surge in that SLR is a gradual and permanent change, while storm surge is a sudden and temporary change. Storm surge was not included in this model.

GeoHaz/Acid_Producing_Rock,https://spatial.tdot.tn.gov/arcgis/rest/services/GeoHaz/Acid_Producing_Rock/MapServer,Map Service,"Tennessee,Tennessee Department of Transportation,EnergyAtlas,GeoHaz","Potentially acid producing rock is a geologic material that contains pyrite or other sulfide minerals (pyrrhotite, marcasite etc.). It is commonly called pyritic rock. When excavated the surface area of the rock that can be exposed directly to air and water greatly increases. When exposed to air and water under the wrong circumstances, acidic drainage can occur. <BR><BR>The layer shown is color coded based on the potential for geologic formations to carry potentially acid producing rock. It is based on the 1:250,000 scale geology map and thus has some limitations due to the scale of the map. The 1:250,000 scale geology base map was used because a statewide GIS map for the 1:24,000 scale quad maps was not available. <BR><BR>Sites colored shades of red or pink are a formation(s) that is(are) known to contain potentially acid producing rock or contains a geologic formation that is known to contain potentially acid producing rock. Formations containing primarily limestone are colored green. This layer is intended to be used as a screening tool to assist TDOT planners, environmental staff, geotechnical engineers and geologists in noting where potentially acid producing rock may be present. It serves as an early alert that a project may contain potentially acid producing rock (commonly called pyrite). It is not intended to be used in lieu of or as a replacement for a geotechnical investigation.",https://spatial.tdot.tn.gov/arcgis/rest/services/GeoHaz/Acid_Producing_Rock/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,7,geology
