Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences).<BR><BR><BR><BR>Connecticut Quaternary Geology is 1:24,000-scale data suitable for geologic and environmental mapping and analysis purposes.

Glacial meltwater deposits (stratified deposits) are particularly emphasized because these sediments are the major groundwater aquifers in the State and are also the major source of construction aggregate. These deposits are described in terms of their subsurface distribution of textures as well as their extent. The texture of meltwater deposits through their total vertical thickness in the subsurface is shown to the extent that it is known or can be inferred. In some places only one textural unit (such as SG - Sand and Gravel) describes the whole vertical extent of the meltwater deposits; in other places 'stacked units' (such as SG/S/F - Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines) indicate changes of textural units in the subsurface. Polygon features represent individual textural (surficial material) units with attributes that describe textural unit type and size. Examples of polygon features that are postglacial deposits include floodplain alluvium, swamp deposits, salt-marsh and estuarine deposits, talus, coastal beach and dune deposits, and artificial fill. Examples of glacial ice-laid deposits include till, thin till, thick till and end moraine deposits. Examples of glacial melt-water deposits include gravel, sand and gravel, sand, and very fine sand, silt and clay.

Well and water level data associated with the creation of these surfaces is included and represents data starting in May 2012. Contour lines are created for the potentiometric surface of the upper Floridan aquifer from water level data submitted by the five water management districts. The points associated with the water level data are added to Geostatistical Analyst and ordinary kriging is used to interpolate water level elevation values between the points. The Geostatistical Analyst layer is then converted to a grid (using GA Layer to grid tool) and then to contour lines (using the Contour tool). Manual editing is done to smooth the lines and fix areas that don't make sense. Errors are usually located where potentiometric highs are adjacent to potentiometric lows (areas where the gradient is high). Expert knowledge or additional information is used to correct the contour lines in these areas. Some additional data may be river stage values in rivers that intersect the Floridan aquifer or land elevation in unconfined areas.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>*Note 12/15/2016: This is a recreation of the original .mxd (FGS_Potentiometric_WaterLevels_SW.mxd).

The maps, source data, and metadata used to generate these products will be archived in a manner suitable for model implementation and regulatory use in a publically accessible format. The results will be incorporated into the forthcoming Lower West Coast Surficial Aquifer System and Intermediate Aquifer System Model (LWCSIM), which will evaluate the potential impact of existing and projected groundwater withdrawals in all SAS and IAS aquifers within the region over the next several decades.For full documentation, please see Technical Publication WS-35, ""Hydrogeologic Unit Mapping Update for the Lower West Coast Water Supply Planning Area,"" dated August 2015 by Elizabeth Geddes, Emily Richardson P.G., and Anne Dodd P.G. , Water Supply Bureau, Water Resources Division, South Florida Water Management District, West Palm Beach, Florida.<BR>",https://mapsprod.sfwmd.gov/map_ssl/rest/services/HYGEO/LWC_Wells/MapServer/info/thumbnail,wells,10,wells
