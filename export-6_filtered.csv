Bedrock geologic formations are described as polygons in terms of formation name (incorporating geologic age), rock type, and tectonic terrane association. Tectonic forces are responsible for the present day geologic configuration of the continents. Resulting terranes are regionally fault bounded rocks of a similar tectonic history. Each terrane is named after its plate tectonics ancestry. Geologic lines include contacts, faults, and terrane boundaries. Terrane boundaries are named for the faults involved. The geologic contacts and faults are delineated and classified by type. Polygon feature attribute information is comprised of codes to identify individual bedrock geologic units, their formation name, description and size. Line feature attributes identify, name and describe bedrock contacts, faults and terrane boundaries between these bedrock geologic units.

This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences).<BR><BR><BR><BR>Connecticut Quaternary Geology is 1:24,000-scale data suitable for geologic and environmental mapping and analysis purposes.

It represents a mosaic of 414 digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQ) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The date of the orthophotography is 1990. The raster mosaic is based on DOQQs that are gray-scale, leaf-off, 1:12,000 scale (1 inch = 1,000 feet), quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) input raster images with 1-meter ground resolution. Input raster DOQQs are in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) format and named ""ortho_1990_quad0078se.tif"" after CT DEP quadrangle number 78, SE quadrant, for example. Each 7.5 minute quadrangle is broken into four quadrants: NE, NW, SE, and SW. Each of these 3.75 minute quarter quadrangles is referred to as a quarter quad.<BR> <BR>Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary orthophoto produced by the USGS is the digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ), a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255.",http://gis.cityofmiddletown.com:6080/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/Ortho_1990/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

Contour lines are created for the potentiometric surface of the upper Floridan aquifer from water level data submitted by the five water management districts. The points associated with the water level data are added to Geostatistical Analyst and ordinary kriging is used to interpolate water level elevation values between the points. The Geostatistical Analyst layer is then converted to a grid (using GA Layer to grid tool) and then to contour lines (using the Contour tool). Manual editing is done to smooth the lines and fix areas that don't make sense. Errors are usually located where potentiometric highs are adjacent to potentiometric lows (areas where the gradient is high). Expert knowledge or additional information is used to correct the contour lines in these areas. Some additional data may be river stage values in rivers that intersect the Floridan aquifer or land elevation in unconfined areas.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>*Note 12/15/2016: This is a recreation of the original .mxd (FGS_Potentiometric_WaterLevels_SW.mxd).

The points associated with the water level data are added to Geostatistical Analyst and ordinary kriging is used to interpolate water level elevation values between the points. The Geostatistical Analyst layer is then converted to a grid (using GA Layer to grid tool) and then to contour lines (using the Contour tool). Manual editing is done to smooth the lines and fix areas that don't make sense. Errors are usually located where potentiometric highs are adjacent to potentiometric lows (areas where the gradient is high).

Many soil samples were analyzed in laboratories. The maps outline areas called map units.

More details were gathered at a scale of 1:12,000 than at a scale of 1:63,360. The mapping is intended for natural resource planning and management by landowners, townships, and counties. Some knowledge of soils data and map scale is necessary to avoid misunderstandings.<BR><BR>STATSGO Soil Association Units for Florida. This data set consists of general soil association units. It was develped by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps.
