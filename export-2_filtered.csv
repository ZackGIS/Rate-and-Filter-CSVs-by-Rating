LTDL_Tool/NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_L48,https://srfs.wr.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/LTDL_Tool/NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_L48/MapServer,Map Service,"USGS - Land Treatments Digital Library,EnergyAtlas","The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released four National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2016 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2016 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

It shows LCMS modeled land use classes for each year. See additional information about land use in the Entity_and_Attribute_Information section below.LCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape change across the United States. Its objective is to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology and advancements in change detection to produce a ""best available"" map of landscape change. Because no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble of models as predictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of ecosystems and change processes (Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer a holistic depiction of landscape change across the United States over the past four decades.Predictor layers for the LCMS model include annual Landsat and Sentinel 2 composites, outputs from the LandTrendr and CCDC change detection algorithms, and terrain information. These components are all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017). To produce annual composites, the cFmask (Zhu and Woodcock 2012), cloudScore, and TDOM (Chastain et al., 2019) cloud and cloud shadow masking methods are applied to Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2a and 2b Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance data. The annual medoid is then computed to summarize each year into a single composite. The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018). All cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using the CCDC algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). The raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences, segment duration, change magnitude, and slope, and CCDC September 1 sine and cosine coefficients (first 3 harmonics), fitted values, and pairwise differences, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, cosine of aspect, and topographic position indices (Weiss, 2001) from the National Elevation Dataset (NED), are used as independent predictor variables in a Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) model. Reference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps analysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present (Cohen et al., 2010).Outputs fall into three categories: change, land cover, and land use. Change relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast loss (which also includes hydrologic changes such as inundation or desiccation), and gain. These values are predicted for each year of the Landsat time series and serve as the foundational products for LCMS.References:Breiman, L. (2001).

The resulting suite of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer a holistic depiction of landscape change across the United States over the past four decades.Predictor layers for the LCMS model include annual Landsat and Sentinel 2 composites, outputs from the LandTrendr and CCDC change detection algorithms, and terrain information. These components are all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017). To produce annual composites, the cFmask (Zhu and Woodcock 2012), cloudScore, and TDOM (Chastain et al., 2019) cloud and cloud shadow masking methods are applied to Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2a and 2b Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance data. The annual medoid is then computed to summarize each year into a single composite. The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018). All cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using the CCDC algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). The raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences, segment duration, change magnitude, and slope, and CCDC September 1 sine and cosine coefficients (first 3 harmonics), fitted values, and pairwise differences, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, cosine of aspect, and topographic position indices (Weiss, 2001) from the National Elevation Dataset (NED), are used as independent predictor variables in a Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) model. Reference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps analysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present (Cohen et al., 2010).Outputs fall into three categories: change, land cover, and land use. Change relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast loss (which also includes hydrologic changes such as inundation or desiccation), and gain. These values are predicted for each year of the Landsat time series and serve as the foundational products for LCMS.References:Breiman, L. (2001).

These datasets encompass CONUS, Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. There are three versions of data within the 2016 TCC Product Suite, which include:The initial model outputs referred to as the Analytical data;A masked version of the initial output referred to as Cartographic data;And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data, which includes a canopy cover change dataset derived from subtraction of datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016.The Analytical data are the initial model outputs generated in the production workflow. These data are best suited for users who will carry out their own detailed statistical and uncertainty analyses on the dataset and place lower priority on the visual appearance of the dataset for cartographic purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The Cartographic products mask the initial model outputs to improve the visual appearance of the datasets. These data are best suited for users who prioritize visual appearance of the data for cartographic and illustrative purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The NLCD data are the result of further processing of the masked data. The goal was to generate three coordinated components. The components are (1) a dataset for the nominal year of 2011, (2) a dataset for the nominal year of 2016, and (3) a dataset that captures the change in canopy cover between the two nominal years of 2011 and 2016. For the NLCD data, the three components meet the criterion of “2011 TCC + change in TCC = 2016 TCC”.

Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The Cartographic products mask the initial model outputs to improve the visual appearance of the datasets. These data are best suited for users who prioritize visual appearance of the data for cartographic and illustrative purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The NLCD data are the result of further processing of the masked data. The goal was to generate three coordinated components. The components are (1) a dataset for the nominal year of 2011, (2) a dataset for the nominal year of 2016, and (3) a dataset that captures the change in canopy cover between the two nominal years of 2011 and 2016. For the NLCD data, the three components meet the criterion of “2011 TCC + change in TCC = 2016 TCC”. These NLCD data are best suited for users who require a coordinated three-component data stack where each pixel’s values meet the criterion of “2011 TCC + change in TCC = 2016 TCC”. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available, as well as a dataset that captures the change (loss or gain) in canopy cover between those two nominal years of 2011 and 2016, in areas where change was identified.These tree canopy cover data are accessible for multiple user communities, through multiple channels and platforms, as listed below:AnalyticalUSFS Tree Canopy Cover DatasetsUSFS Enterprise Data WarehouseCartographicUSFS Tree Canopy Cover DatasetsNLCDMulti-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) ConsortiumUSFS Enterprise Data WarehouseThe Coastal Alaska TCC 2016 NLCD dataset is comprised of a single layer.

For nearly all pixels, the values meet the criterion of “2011 TCC + change in TCC = 2016 TCC”. However, there are some pixels with no TCC values because of a lack of imagery in persistently cloudy areas. These data gaps were given a value 127. In summary, if a data gap was present in the original 2011 or 2016 data, that data gap was carried through to all three components of the NLCD data.

Positive FVI values indicate forest areas that have experienced statistically significant trends in rising temperatures and increasing water deficits from 2003 to 2012. These trends lead to expected forest vulnerability, although forest type specific responses will vary. The FVI is the slope of the monthly Forest Stress Index (FSI) from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October) calculated using ordinary least square regression and normalized by Forest Type Group. A p-value layer is associated with each month’s FVI layer. The p-value layer is used to declare statistically significant any increases or decreases in FVI slopes to evaluate vulnerability. When the FVI and p-value layers are used together it results in three general FVI outcomes for any given pixel on the landscape: a (1) positive or (2) negative statistically significant FVI slope, and (3) statistically insignificant slopes. The FVI was developed by incorporating the alterations to canopy water and energy exchange processes caused by drought and high temperatures with spatially continuous MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST), Evapotranspiration (ET) and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation (P) data.With P and ET, we calculate a monthly water balance variable for each individual pixel normalized by forest type group (FTG), and then difference the water balance with the corresponding normalized monthly mean LST to calculate a monthly Forest Stress Index (FSI). We then extract the pixel specific statistically significant trends of the FSI from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October).

Estimates of BFI values at ungaged streams and BFI-based ground-water recharge estimates are useful for interpreting relations between land use and water quality in surface and ground water.This data for Oregon is a subset of BFI for the conterminous United States. The 1-kilometer raster (grid) dataset for the conterminous United States was created by interpolating base-flow index (BFI) values estimated at U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamgages. Base flow is the component of streamflow that can be attributed to ground-water discharge into streams. The BFI is the ratio of base flow to total flow, expressed as a percentage. The BFI grid was interpolated from BFI point values estimated for USGS streamgages (Wolock, 2003a). These point values were computed using an automated hydrograph separation computer program called the BFI program (Wahl and Wahl, 1988; 1995). Regarding this computer program, the BFI Web page (http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/twahl/bfi/index.html) states: ""The BFI program was developed to make the base-flow separation process less tedious and more objective. The program implements a deterministic procedure proposed in 1980 by the British Institute of Hydrology (Institute of Hydrology, 1980). The method combines a local minimums approach with a recession slope test. The program estimates the annual base-flow volume of unregulated rivers and streams and computes an annual base-flow index (BFI, the ratio of base flow to total flow volume for a given year) for multiple years of data at one or more gage sites. Although the method may not yield the true base flow as might be determined by a more sophisticated analysis, the index has been found to be consistent and indicative of base flow, and thus may be useful for analysis of long term base-flow trends. Users should be very cautious about using methods such as this for short-term storm events or for locations where streamflow is affected by upstream regulation, such as reservoir releases. In general, the method interprets most regulated releases as base flow. If the program is used for regulated streams, the effects of regulation must be carefully accounted for through manual adjustment of the program output."" (2) Estimation of base-flow index (BFI) values for ungaged streams: In a previous analysis of historical streamgage data (Wolock, 2003a), BFI values were estimated for more than 19,000 streamgages. Using a subset of this large dataset, a regression equation that could predict BFI values from drainage basin characteristics was developed, but the predictive power of the equation was limited. As an alternative approach, the BFI grid was produced (see Process_Description) and provided a statistically more powerful method to estimate BFI values at ungaged streams. The method used to estimate a BFI value for an ungaged stream only requires that the drainage basin be delineated for that stream. The average value for the BFI grid within the drainage basin of the ungaged stream is used as the estimate of the BFI value for the stream. This method was applied to a set of 473 gaged streams (with drainage basin areas ranging from 32 to 119,000 square kilometers), and the grid-based and streamgage estimates of BFI values were compared. The percentage explained variance (R-square value) was 67 percent in the analysis. (3) Estimation of natural ground-water recharge throughout the conterminous United States: A raster dataset of natural ground-water recharge can be created by multiplying the grid of base-flow index (BFI) values by a grid of mean annual runoff values. For example, Wolock (2003b) created a natural ground-water recharge dataset by multiplying the BFI grid by a mean annual runoff grid derived from Gebert's 1951-80 mean annual runoff contour map (Gebert and others, 1987). This approach is similar to those reported in some other studies (Holtschlag, 1997; Dumouchelle and Schiefer, 2002). The concept used to generate a natural ground-water recharge grid in this manner is based on two assumptions: (1) long-term average natural ground-water recharge is equal to long-term average natural ground-water discharge, and (2) the BFI reasonably represents, over the long term, the percentage of ground-water discharge in streamflow. This approach to estimating ground-water recharge is likely to underestimate ""true"" recharge in areas where irrigation is used extensively and also in areas where ground-water evapotranspiration is significant. More details about the approach and its limitations can be found in Wolock (2003b).

Condition, relates to reporting landowner compliance with deed terms related to ownership of stewardship lands by the Federal Government. To facilitate the reporting requirement, the NRCS acquires digital high-resolution, 15 cm GSD, 4-band, ortho-rectified fixed wing aerial imagery to ensure compliance of NRCS easements enrolled in the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program-Wetlands Reserve Easements (ACEP-WRE), the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program-Agricultural Lands Easements (ACEP-ALE), the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), Healthy Forests Reserve program (HFRP), Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP), the emergency Watershed Program-Floodplain Easements (EWPP-FPE) and the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program (EWRP) as well as Other Stewardship Lands (OSL). NRCS uses digital high-resolution imagery to strengthen the integrity of monitoring on conservation easement lands using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies and photo interpretation. </span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Purpose: </span><span>To provide easements imagery acquisition collection information and locations.</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'><span>Creation Date: </span></span><span>20210221-20211023</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'><span>Publication Date: </span></span><span>20211118</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Revision Date: </span></span><span>20220224</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Refresh Cycle: </span><span>Periodically as new imagery becomes available</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'><span>Version: </span></span><span>1.1.0</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Change Log: </span><span>Service Deployed</span><span style='font-weight:bold;'> </span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span /><a href='mailto:usdafpacbc@servicenowservices.com?Subject=GEOSRV' style='text-decoration:underline;'><span style='font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;'><span>Report Service Errors</span></span></a></p></div></div></div>",https://nrcsgeoservices.sc.egov.usda.gov/arcgis/rest/services/easements/imagery2021metadata/MapServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

Mitigating these threats requires analyzing their spatial distribution, making benthic habitat mapping a key component to the conservation and management activities of state and federal agencies.",https://maps2.coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/MarineCadastre/BenthicCover/MapServer/info/thumbnail,environmental,7,imagery

Measurements were taken from 42,000 grid points out to a distance of 50 nautical miles from shore. Values represent the average instantaneous power generated by a meter length of wave crest per grid point. In accordance with accepted global practice, wave power density is measured in kilowatts per meter of wave crest aggregated across a unit diameter circle. Data were classified using quantiles. Bathymetric effects are known to have a large effect on wave characteristics at depths shallower than ~20m on the east coast and ~50m on the west coast.

It was created by manually delineating and classifying habitats visible in a 0.3x0.3 meter aerial photograph mosaic, and by using edge detection algorithms and boosted regression trees to automatically delineate and classify habitat features visible in 0.3x0.3 meter LiDAR surfaces. Habitat features less than 100 square meters were not delineated from the orthomosaic, and were removed from habitat polygons derived from the LiDAR surfaces using ET Geowizards ArcGIS extension. Manually delineated habitat polygons were digitized at a scale of 1:1,000. Habitat polygon boundaries derived from the LiDAR surfaces were smoothed in ArcGIS to more closely match the 1:1,000 scale used for manual digitizing. Georeferenced underwater video & photos were used to train the analyst and algorithm to classify the major and detailed geomorphological structure, percent hard bottom, major and detailed biological cover and live coral cover for each polygon. The thematic accuracy of the map was assessed qualitatively by local experts and quantitatively using randomly sampled locations stratified by detailed geomorpholoigcal structure type. Thematic accuracies for major and detailed geomorphological structure, percent hardbottom, major and detailed biological cover, live coral cover and dominant coral type were: 93.0%, 75.1%, 86.2%, 86.5%, 74.5%, 83.3% and 88.2%, respectively. These thematic accuracies are similar to the thematic accuracies reported for other NOAA benthic habitat mapping efforts around Buck Island in St. Croix (>81.4%), in St. John (>80%), in the Main Eight Hawaiian Islands (>84.0%) and in the Republic of Palau (>80.0%).<BR><BR>For more information, visit the project website at http://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=171",https://idpgis.ncep.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NOS_Biogeo_Biomapper/STEER_Dynamic/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,8,geology

Flash Flood Guidance is an estimate of the amount of rainfall required over a given area during a given duration to cause small streams to flood. These estimates are based on the current soil moisture and stream flow conditions for the area. The RFCs issue FFG grids at 4-km resolution for 1-, 3-, and 6-hour rainfall durations, with the Ohio RFC additionally issuing FFG grids for 12- and 24-hour durations. The Northwest RFC does not provide FFG data for Washington and Oregon from the Pacific coast eastward across the Cascade Mountains. Once per hour, WPC checks for updated data from the RFCs and combines the latest grids from each RFC into a mosaicked CONUS-wide gridded product. The data are slightly upscaled to 5-km resolution, with a minor amount of smoothing applied at RFC boundaries to reduce discontinuities. However, note that the methodology used to calculate FFG varies from RFC to RFC, so users will notice stark boundary discontinuities in certain parts of the country; this is particularly true across the northern CONUS RFCs.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Link to </SPAN><A href=""http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/metadata/rfc_gridded_ffg.xml""><SPAN>metadata</SPAN></A></P><P><SPAN>Questions/Concerns about the service, please contatct the </SPAN><A href=""mailto:idp.gis.support@noaa.gov""><SPAN>IDP-GIS </SPAN></A><SPAN>team</SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P><P><SPAN STYLE=""font-weight:bold;"">Time Information:</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>This service is not time enabled</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>",https://idpgis.ncep.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NWS_Forecasts_Guidance_Warnings/rfc_gridded_ffg/MapServer/info/thumbnail,weather,8,weather

The different<BR>types of forecast guidance are described below.<BR></p><BR><BR><h4>Weather Model Output Statistics (MOS) Forecast Guidance</h4><BR><p><BR>This layer provides hyperlinks to NWS computer-based weather point forecast<BR>guidance called Model Output Statistics (MOS). MOS is a numerical-statistical<BR>weather forecast technique and typically provides objective forecasts of<BR>sensible surface weather elements including: daily maximum and minimum<BR>temperatures; 2m air temperature and dew point temperature; wind speed and<BR>direction; categorical cloud, precipitation, and snowfall amounts; categorical<BR>precipitation type, ceiling height, visibility, and obstruction to vision; and<BR>the probability of precipitation, thunderstorms, severe weather, freezing<BR>precipitation, and snow. MOS guidance is generated four times per day using<BR>inputs from different NWS/NCEP numerical weather prediction forecast modeling<BR>systems. The technique uses predictions from the latest forecast cycles of the<BR>NWS/NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS), NWS/NCEP North American Mesoscale (NAM)<BR>numerical weather prediction model, and GFS Extension. The text bulletins<BR>containing MOS guidance from these three runs are identified with the notation<BR>MAV, MET, and GFSX, respectively. In addition, MOS forecast guidance is also<BR>generated four times per day for 121 marine sites (e.g. fixed buoys, C-MAN<BR>stations) located in and around the continental United States, Alaska, and<BR>Hawaii. The marine guidance includes forecasts of wind direction (WD) and wind<BR>speed (WS) at the observing height, and for wind speed adjusted to be<BR>consistent with a measurement height of 10 m above ground or water surface<BR>(WS10). The wind direction forecasts are rounded to the nearest degree and wind<BR>speed forecasts to the nearest knot, air temperature (TMP) and dew point<BR>temperature (DPT) rounded to the nearest degree Fahrenheit. The marine guidance<BR>is available forecast projections 6 through 78 hours in advance at 3-hr<BR>increments, from the initial model times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC.

The map<BR>is based on probabilistic storm surge guidance developed by the NWS<BR>Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL), in cooperation with NHC, called<BR>Probabilistic Hurricane Storm Surge (P-Surge 2.5).<BR></p><BR><p><BR>P-Surge 2.5 derives storm surge probabilities by statistically evaluating a <BR>large set of SLOSH model simulations based on the current NHC official<BR>forecast, and takes into account historical errors in the official NHC track<BR>and intensity forecasts. P-Surge 2.5 combines the results of hundreds of<BR>individual SLOSH simulations to calculate the statistical distribution, or<BR>probabilities of possible storm surge heights at locations along the coast. All<BR>major factors that influence the amount of storm surge generated by a storm at<BR>a given location are accounted for, including the hurricane's landfall<BR>location, forward speed, and angle of approach to the coast; the storm<BR>intensity and wind field; the shape of the coastline; the slope of the ocean<BR>bottom; and local features such as barrier islands, bays, and rivers. The<BR>Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map is created by processing the resulting 10<BR>percent exceedance levels from P-Surge 2.5, or storm surge values that have a<BR>1-in-10 chance of being exceeded at each location.<BR></p><BR><p><BR>The Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map takes into account:<BR></p><BR><ul><BR> <li>Flooding due to storm surge from the ocean, including adjoining tidal rivers, sounds, and bays</li><BR> <li>Normal astronomical tides</li><BR> <li>Land elevation</li><BR> <li>Uncertainties in the landfall location, forward speed, angle of approach to the coast, intensity, and wind field of the cyclone</li><BR></ul><BR><p><BR>The Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map does not take into account:<BR></p><BR><ul><BR> <li>Wave action</li><BR> <li>Freshwater flooding from rainfall</li><BR> <li>Flooding resulting from levee failures</li><BR> <li>For mapped leveed areas - flooding inside levees, overtopping of levees</li><BR></ul><BR><p><BR>Potential storm surge flooding is not depicted within certain levee areas, such<BR>as the Hurricane &amp; Storm Damage Risk Reduction System in Louisiana.

If applicable to the region displayed by the map,<BR>these leveed areas will be depicted with a black and white diagonal hatch<BR>pattern.<BR></p><BR><p><BR>The intertidal zone, or generally speaking, the area that is above water at low<BR>tide and under water at high tide, will be displayed with a user selectable<BR>mask layer on the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map. Locations of estuarine<BR>wetlands, or lands that are saturated with water, either permanently or<BR>seasonally, are also used to help define this mask layer.

The success of that long-term effort depends on locating and securing significant quantities of OCS sediment resources that are compatible with the target environments being restored. Offshore sand resources, like upland sources, are extremely scarce where most needed. Additionally, sizable areas of these relatively small offshore sand resources are not extractable because of the presence of oil and gas infrastructure, archaeologically sensitive areas, and biologically sensitive areas. Since the use of OCS sediment resources is authorized by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the bureau is implementing measures to help safeguard the most significant OCS sediment resources, reduce multiple use conflicts, and minimize interference with oil and gas operations under existing leases or rights-of-way. OCS sediment resources refer to the sediment deposit(s), including clay, silt, sand, and gravel size particles and shell, found on or below the surface of the seabed on the OCS, as defined in Section 2(a) of the OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. § 1331(a)). This data delineates the surface location of significant Outer Continental Shelf sediment resources in the Gulf of Mexico. Bottom-disturbing activities, including but not limited to surface or near-surface emplacement of platforms, wells, drilling rigs, pipelines, umbilicals, and cables should avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, significant OCS sediment resources.

The fishing depths were selected based on commercial shark fishing log summaries, which indicated that the primary depths of effort were 18-73 m (10 to 40 fm). A random stratified sampling design with three depth strata; 18-36 m (10-20 fm), 36-55 m (20-30 fm) and 55-73 m (30-40 fm) were used and uniform effort across contiguous 60 nautical mile sampling zones was achieved. Based on analysis of the first two survey years, the 1997 survey was modified by eliminating depth stratification and changing the survey depths to 10-55 m (5-30 fm). The depth reduction was at the request of the SEFSC to ensure that the full range of several coastal sharks was encompassed by the survey. Elimination of depth stratification was to avoid over-sampling strata which represented the least available habitat (the 30-40 fm strata represented very little of the available bottom, but was receiving 33% of the effort). A significant event in the evolution of our longline surveys occurred in 1999 when we were requested to implement a longline survey targeting red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). At the time, red snapper were not specifically targeted as part of the shark surveys; a different hook type (circle hook) was used, and different depth strata were sampled. The snapper work was conducted between 64-146 m (35-80 fm) in an area from east of the Mississippi River to south of Perdido Key, Florida. Random sampling without proportional allocation was used and sampling units were 10 nautical mile blocks given the small geographical area to be covered. In 2001, the shark and red snapper surveys were combined into a single annual survey of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Proportional allocation based on shelf width within statistical zones was adopted and the survey was stratified by depth with 50% allocation in 9-55 m, 40% allocation from 55-183 m and 10% allocation from 188-366 m. This allocation provided effort in the 9-55 m strata comparable to that achieved in previous shark surveys, thereby preserving the time series back to 1995. The major change in the shark surveys was adoption of the Circle hook as the standard for these surveys. A small longline spool holds approximately 5 nautical mile 4.0 mm diameter monofilament line (900 - 1200 lb; 401.8 - 535.7 kg test); up to 10 nautical miles for large spools. Prior to bottom longline deployment, the mainline is attached to a high flyer (radar reflecting buoy). High flyers are attached at both ends of the deployed mainline for visual reference and to facilitate gear retrieval. As the bottom longline is deployed the vessel’s GPS is used to determine distance covered. Because of the constant cutting and reattachment of the mainline and potential loss of sections of line over the course of a survey, the mainline is not marked in sections and the length of mainline deployed is based on GPS intervals. One-hundred gangions (monofilament leaders with AK snap attachment clip and hook) are attached to 1 nautical mile of mainline approximately equidistantly (about every 60 ft or 31 m) throughout the set. Gangion spacing is determined by GPS (i.e., at 1/10 nautical mile 10 evenly spaced gangions should have been deployed) and nautical mile increments are relayed to the gear set crew by hand-held 2-way radios. An electronic beeper (interval based on vessel speed) is often used to determine component attachment intervals. Weights (5 - 10 kg) are attached to the beginning, middle and end of the bottom longline to prevent gear from rising in the water column, as well as to minimize horizontal movement. After the end weight is attached to the bottom longline gear, the mainline is cut and attached to the second high flyer. Prior to the gear haul back, the mainline is reattached to the remaining line on the spool. Buoy lines (or drop lines) are continuations of the mainline and are not separate gear components but are created by deploying an adequate amount of mainline monofilament for tethering high flyer buoys to the bottom longline gear. Buoys/high flyers are used only on the distal ends without a mid-set buoy. To properly calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE) and a variety of additional statistical analyses, it is important to document longline set, gear soak and longline haul back events. There are 4 critical events; first high flyer deployed (beginning of the set), last high flyer deployed (end of the set), first high flyer retrieved (beginning of haul back) and last high flyer retrieved (end of haul back). Minimum data elements required for each event are the date, time, bottom depth, latitude and longitude. Standard sets are 1 hr in duration with 100 hooks attached along 1 nautical mile of mainline. There are a number of situations that can affect the haul back duration including; high catch rates where data reporting requirements and tagging necessitate slowing the retrieval process, large fish entangling gangions and other gear components, gear entanglement with bottom obstructions and turtle encounters. If the haul back is delayed, some of the hooks deployed near the end of the set soak for more than the 1 hr standard. However, since the time event is recorded for the final high flyer brought aboard to end the haul back, extended haul back times are documented. Gear soak time is an important element in calculating fishing effort (catch per unit effort, CPUE, expressed as the number of captures by species/100 hook hr). Soak time is defined during SEFSC surveys, and often for other surveys, as the time between deployment of the last high flyer to end the set to the time of retrieval of the first high flyer to begin haul back. Since the beginning and end of the soak period are essential data elements, soaks that deviate from the standard 1 hr can be accounted for during data analysis. It is possible to use critical events for re-evaluating effort calculations if needed since the 4 critical events are data elements (begin set, end set, begin haul back and end haul back). Ideally, sets are conducted parallel to depth contours with reasonable effort made to maintain a uniform bottom depth and vessel speed throughout the set. Maintaining a uniform set depth can be difficult and may not be feasible when setting gear along areas of high relief or in high winds or currents. Gear is set from the stern of the vessel and communications between the deck crew and helmsman are maintained via hand held two-way radios. Set procedures are generally standard and should be maintained for consistent effort. Primary set procedures and events include; wheel house to deck notification of the set event, deploying the first high flyer, attachment of the first weight, attaching gangions at approximately equidistant increments, attachment of the mid-weight, completing gangion deployment, attaching the last weight, and deploying the last high flyer to mark the set termination point.

The SEAMAP Spring Plankton Survey began in 1982 while the SEAMAP Fall Plankton Survey began in 1985. A SEAMAP Winter Plankton Survey took place in 1983, 1984, 1993, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2011. Plankton sampling is carried out during these surveys at predetermined SEAMAP stations arranged in a fixed, systematic grid pattern across the entire Gulf of Mexico. Most but not all SEAMAP stations (designated by a unique SEAMAP number) are located at ~56 km or 0.5-degree intervals along this grid. Some SEAMAP stations are located at less than 56 km intervals especially along the continental shelf edge, while others have been moved to avoid obstructions, navigational hazards, or shallow water. Most SEAMAP plankton samples are taken during either dedicated plankton or shrimp/groundfish surveys, but over the years additional samples were taken using SEAMAP gear and collection methods at locations other than designated SEAMAP stations and/or outside established SEAMAP surveys, e.g. during Louisiana seasonal trawl surveys, SEAMAP Squid/Butterfish survey; and other serendipitous or special projects. Although other plankton sampling gear types and mesh sizes have been used throughout the SEAMAP time series, the standard sampling gear and methodology used to collect plankton samples during SEAMAP surveys are bongo and/or neuston nets. A 61 cm (outside diameter) bongo net fitted with 0.335 mm mesh netting is fished in an oblique tow path from a maximum depth of 200 m or to 2-5 m off the bottom at station depths less than 200 m. A single or double, 2x1 m pipe frame neuston net fitted with 0.950 mm mesh netting is the other standard gear employed and it is towed at the surface with the frame half-submerged for 10 minutes. Maximum bongo tow depth is calculated using the amount of wire paid out and the wire angle at the ‘targeted’ maximum tow depth, or observed and recorded in real time throughout the tow. A mechanical flowmeter is mounted off-center in the mouth of each bongo net to record the volume of water filtered. During surveys in the early part of the time series a flowmeter was placed in only one side of the bongo gear. Water volume filtered during bongo net tows ranges from ~20 to 600 m3 but is typically 30 to 40 m3 at the shallowest stations and 300 to 400 m3 at the deepest stations. <BR><BR>This map presents the relative abundance (number per hour) of larval king mackerel, red snapper, spanish mackerel, and vermilion snapper by 30-minute longitude by latitude blocks. Data are from 2,342 bongo net samples taken from 1986 to 2006 as part of plankton sampling associated with the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) Fall Plankton Survey.

In 1964, Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act.

A Federal SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative, (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SMA Withdrawals will include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the individual withdrawal actions that created them over time.A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined when the land is either: Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action, or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices. The GIS data contained in this dataset represents the polygon features that show the boundaries for Surface Management Agency and the surface extent of each Federal agency’s surface administrative jurisdiction. SMA data depicts current withdrawn areas for a particular agency and (when appropriate) includes land that was acquired or exchanged and is located outside of a withdrawal area for that agency.

In 1964, Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act. The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water.<BR><BR>Below is the updated list of Congressionally submitted and approved Arizona wilderness area boundaries as required by the legislation. All have been surveyed and/or have legal descriptions documented. The other wilderness area boundaries not included in this list, have not been submitted to Congress, and represent line work of the original mapping on 1:24,000 scale maps when the bills were originally submitted to Congress. We are continuing to work on the these other wilderness boundaries in the State. When their wilderness boundaries are finalized and approved by Congress, the new boundaries will be included in this data layer.Wilderness Area Serialized, Case File Number: Aravaipa Canyon, AZA 25467; Muggins Mountain, AZA 25501; Eagletail Mountains, AZA 25497; Mount Trumbull, AZA 25618; South Maricopa Mountains, AZA 25489; Dos Cabezas Mountains, AZA 25470; Mount Nutt, AZA 25482; Mount Tipton AZA 25483; North Maricopa Mountains, AZA 25486; Peloncillo Mountains, AZA 25473; Redfield Canyon, AZA 25474; Cottonwood Point, AZA 25614; Mt Logan, AZA 25617; Baboquivari Peak, AZA 25468; Coyote Mountains, AZA 25469; Mount Wilson, AZA 25484; Aubery Peak, AZA 25476; Fishooks, AZA 25471; Harcuvar Mountains, AZA 25500; White Canyon, AZA 25495; North Santa Teresa, AZA 25472; Tres Alamos, AZA 25491; Hells Canyon, AZA 25480; Hassayampa River Canyon, AZA 25479.<BR><BR>The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directed the Bureau to inventory and study its roadless areas for wilderness characteristics. To be designated as a Wilderness Study Area, an area had to have the following characteristics: Size - roadless areas of at least 5,000 acres of public lands or of a manageable size; Naturalness - generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature; Opportunities - provides outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation. In addition, Wilderness Study Areas often have special qualities such as ecological, geological, educational, historical, scientific and scenic values.<BR><BR>For metadata and to download the dataset, please visit Navigator here: https://navigator.blm.gov/data?id=b59b3b449da0a263",https://gis.blm.gov/azarcgis/rest/services/nlcs/BLM_AZ_WLD/MapServer/info/thumbnail,oil,8,licenses
visual/BLM_AZ_VRM,https://gis.blm.gov/azarcgis/rest/services/visual/BLM_AZ_VRM/MapServer,Map Service,"DOI - Bureau of Land Management,EnergyAtlas,visual","Decisions on the management of visual resources are made through the land use planning process. The land use plan decisions that direct the management of visual resources are established by designating VRM class objectives, which describe the desired future condition of the landscape when implementing the land use plan. VRM class objectives are designated for all BLM-administered public lands.<BR>VRM class objectives are applied to spatially delineated visual management units designated for all BLM public lands during the land use planning process. Each VRM class objective is definitive, authoritative, and measurable. They establish the thresholds of allowable visual change to the landscape character and set forth the criteria to which land use authorizations shall conform. These area-specific objectives provide the standards for planning, designing, and evaluating future management actions when implementing the land use plan.<BR>The VRI serves as the principal consideration when making VRM decisions that may protect or affect the landscape character and its scenic integrity during land use planning. The inventory values are considered in combination, as a unit (VRI classes), and independently (individual factors of scenic quality, sensitivity, and distance zones) when evaluating land use plan alternatives and making land use plan decisions.<BR>Decisions on VRM class objectives also take into consideration other resource values that have management objectives that may or may not coincide with the protection of visual resources. Designating the appropriate VRM class objectives results from a coordinated and detailed examination of opportunities to protect visual values that also accounts for other program directives that require protective visual management of sensitive resource values while also aiming for compatibility with resource use and development allocations.<BR>The VRM Class I management objective is to preserve the natural character of the landscape, and minimal visual change from human activities is allowed. VRM Class II and III lands allow progressively greater amounts of visual change to the existing landscape, while VRM Class IV lands provide for management activities which require major modification of the existing character of the landscape, and the level of change to the characteristic landscape can be high. Once the VRM class is determined for a tract of BLM-administered land in the RMP, BLM policy requires that proposed management activities on that tract, such as constructing and operating energy facilities, must meet the requirements of the VRM class.<BR>Guidance regarding BLM's VRM class objectives is contained in BLM Manual 8410 - Visual Resource Inventory (Issued 1986, 28 pp). See the BLM VRM page within the Visual Resource Management section of this website for more detailed information on BLM's VRM classes and processes.

In 1964, Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act. The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water.<BR><BR>Below is the updated list of Congressionally submitted and approved Arizona wilderness area boundaries as required by the legislation. All have been surveyed and/or have legal descriptions documented. The other wilderness area boundaries not included in this list, have not been submitted to Congress, and represent line work of the original mapping on 1:24,000 scale maps when the bills were originally submitted to Congress. We are continuing to work on the these other wilderness boundaries in the State.

To be designated as a Wilderness Study Area, an area had to have the following characteristics: Size - roadless areas of at least 5,000 acres of public lands or of a manageable size; Naturalness - generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature; Opportunities - provides outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation.

visual/BLM_AZ_VRM,https://gis.blm.gov/azarcgis/rest/services/visual/BLM_AZ_VRM/MapServer,Map Service,"DOI - Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,EnergyAtlas,visual","Decisions on the management of visual resources are made through the land use planning process. The land use plan decisions that direct the management of visual resources are established by designating VRM class objectives, which describe the desired future condition of the landscape when implementing the land use plan. VRM class objectives are designated for all BLM-administered public lands.<BR>VRM class objectives are applied to spatially delineated visual management units designated for all BLM public lands during the land use planning process. Each VRM class objective is definitive, authoritative, and measurable. They establish the thresholds of allowable visual change to the landscape character and set forth the criteria to which land use authorizations shall conform. These area-specific objectives provide the standards for planning, designing, and evaluating future management actions when implementing the land use plan.<BR>The VRI serves as the principal consideration when making VRM decisions that may protect or affect the landscape character and its scenic integrity during land use planning. The inventory values are considered in combination, as a unit (VRI classes), and independently (individual factors of scenic quality, sensitivity, and distance zones) when evaluating land use plan alternatives and making land use plan decisions.<BR>Decisions on VRM class objectives also take into consideration other resource values that have management objectives that may or may not coincide with the protection of visual resources. Designating the appropriate VRM class objectives results from a coordinated and detailed examination of opportunities to protect visual values that also accounts for other program directives that require protective visual management of sensitive resource values while also aiming for compatibility with resource use and development allocations.<BR>The VRM Class I management objective is to preserve the natural character of the landscape, and minimal visual change from human activities is allowed. VRM Class II and III lands allow progressively greater amounts of visual change to the existing landscape, while VRM Class IV lands provide for management activities which require major modification of the existing character of the landscape, and the level of change to the characteristic landscape can be high. Once the VRM class is determined for a tract of BLM-administered land in the RMP, BLM policy requires that proposed management activities on that tract, such as constructing and operating energy facilities, must meet the requirements of the VRM class.<BR>Guidance regarding BLM's VRM class objectives is contained in BLM Manual 8410 - Visual Resource Inventory (Issued 1986, 28 pp). See the BLM VRM page within the Visual Resource Management section of this website for more detailed information on BLM's VRM classes and processes.

These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2016 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2016 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

maps/US120ESP,https://srfs.wr.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/maps/US120ESP/MapServer,Map Service,"USGS - Snake River Field Station,EnergyAtlas,maps","The environmental site potential (ESP) data layer represents the vegetation that could be supported at a given site based on the biophysical environment. Map units are named according to NatureServe's Ecological Systems classification, which is a nationally consistent set of mid-scale ecological units (Comer and others 2003). Usage of these classification units to describe environmental site potential, however, differs from the original intent of Ecological Systems as units of existing vegetation. As used in LANDFIRE, map unit names represent the natural plant communities that would become established at late or climax stages of successional development in the absence of disturbance. They reflect the current climate and physical environment, as well as the competitive potential of native plant species. The ESP layer is similar in concept to other approaches to classifying potential vegetation in the western United States, including habitat types (for example, Daubenmire 1968 and Pfister and others 1977) and plant associations (for example, Henderson and others 1989).
