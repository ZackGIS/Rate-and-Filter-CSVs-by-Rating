Positive FVI values indicate forest areas that have experienced statistically significant trends in rising temperatures and increasing water deficits from 2003 to 2012. These trends lead to expected forest vulnerability, although forest type specific responses will vary. The FVI is the slope of the monthly Forest Stress Index (FSI) from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October) calculated using ordinary least square regression and normalized by Forest Type Group. A p-value layer is associated with each month’s FVI layer. The p-value layer is used to declare statistically significant any increases or decreases in FVI slopes to evaluate vulnerability. When the FVI and p-value layers are used together it results in three general FVI outcomes for any given pixel on the landscape: a (1) positive or (2) negative statistically significant FVI slope, and (3) statistically insignificant slopes. The FVI was developed by incorporating the alterations to canopy water and energy exchange processes caused by drought and high temperatures with spatially continuous MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST), Evapotranspiration (ET) and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation (P) data.With P and ET, we calculate a monthly water balance variable for each individual pixel normalized by forest type group (FTG), and then difference the water balance with the corresponding normalized monthly mean LST to calculate a monthly Forest Stress Index (FSI). We then extract the pixel specific statistically significant trends of the FSI from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October). Statistically significant positive slopes indicate inter-annual increases in stress leading to expected forest vulnerability (positive FVI).

The NWS is making progress in<BR>this area, and recognizes that this is a significant issue in which<BR>improvements are still needed. The NDFD was developed by NWS Meteorological<BR>Development Laboratory.<BR></p><BR><BR><h4>Time Information</h4><BR><BR><p><BR>This nowCOAST&trade; map service is not time-enabled, although it does contain<BR>time-varying data.

The hyperlink is stored in the ""URL""<BR>attribute field.<BR></p><BR><BR><h4>Model Forecast Point Guidance</h4><BR><p><BR>This map layer procides geo-referenced hyperlinks to the latest NWS<BR>meteorological model forecast guidance and NOS and NWS oceanographic forecast<BR>guidance at specific geographic locations (i.e. forecast points). The different<BR>types of forecast guidance are described below.<BR></p><BR><BR><h4>Weather Model Output Statistics (MOS) Forecast Guidance</h4><BR><p><BR>This layer provides hyperlinks to NWS computer-based weather point forecast<BR>guidance called Model Output Statistics (MOS). MOS is a numerical-statistical<BR>weather forecast technique and typically provides objective forecasts of<BR>sensible surface weather elements including: daily maximum and minimum<BR>temperatures; 2m air temperature and dew point temperature; wind speed and<BR>direction; categorical cloud, precipitation, and snowfall amounts; categorical<BR>precipitation type, ceiling height, visibility, and obstruction to vision; and<BR>the probability of precipitation, thunderstorms, severe weather, freezing<BR>precipitation, and snow. MOS guidance is generated four times per day using<BR>inputs from different NWS/NCEP numerical weather prediction forecast modeling<BR>systems. The technique uses predictions from the latest forecast cycles of the<BR>NWS/NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS), NWS/NCEP North American Mesoscale (NAM)<BR>numerical weather prediction model, and GFS Extension. The text bulletins<BR>containing MOS guidance from these three runs are identified with the notation<BR>MAV, MET, and GFSX, respectively. In addition, MOS forecast guidance is also<BR>generated four times per day for 121 marine sites (e.g. fixed buoys, C-MAN<BR>stations) located in and around the continental United States, Alaska, and<BR>Hawaii. The marine guidance includes forecasts of wind direction (WD) and wind<BR>speed (WS) at the observing height, and for wind speed adjusted to be<BR>consistent with a measurement height of 10 m above ground or water surface<BR>(WS10). The wind direction forecasts are rounded to the nearest degree and wind<BR>speed forecasts to the nearest knot, air temperature (TMP) and dew point<BR>temperature (DPT) rounded to the nearest degree Fahrenheit. The marine guidance<BR>is available forecast projections 6 through 78 hours in advance at 3-hr<BR>increments, from the initial model times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. The<BR>guidance is presented in table format.

Specifically, the layer contains links to time-series plots<BR>displaying guidance from 1) NOS coastal, estuarine, and Great Lakes numerical<BR>ocean circulation forecast modeling systems and 2) NWS Extratropical Storm<BR>Surge (ETSS) Model. The links are to NOS/CO-OPS or NWS/MDL web pages displaying<BR>time series plots of guidance for the next few days from NOS forecast systems<BR>and NWS ETSS Model, respectively. In some locations, water level forecast<BR>guidance is available from BOTH the ETSS model and a NOS forecast model (Links<BR>to point forecast guidance from NOS Extratropical Tide and Surge Operational<BR>Forecast System (ESTOFS) are not presently available on nowCOAST&trade;).<BR></p><BR><BR><h4>Water Currents Model Forecast Guidance</h4><BR><p><BR>This layer provides hyperlinks to the latest point forecast guidance of water<BR>currents from NOS numerical oceanographic forecast model forecast modeling<BR>systems.

The links are to NOS/CO-OPS web pages displaying time-series plots<BR>of guidance for the next 48 to 60 hours.<BR></p><BR><BR><h4>Astronomical Tide Predictions</h4><BR><p><BR>This layer includes links to to NOS' official astronomical tidal predictions<BR>for primary and secondary water level stations. The tidal predictions were<BR>generated using harmonic prediction, a method of predicting tides by combining<BR>harmonic constituents into a single tidal curve. The predictions are made at<BR>stations which have officially accepted harmonic constituents and accepted<BR>datums. These reference stations include both presently operating and<BR>historical NOS water level observing (i.e. tide) stations.

Each 1.2-km BOEM aliquot grid cell was assigned a mean wind speed that corresponds to the nearest 2-km Vaisala grid cell representing the majority of its area. The time-varying component of wind speed was calculated by analyzing the nearest MERRA 17-year time-series record. The Weibull parameters were estimated from the MERRA wind speeds by computing the parameters of a Weibull distribution that has the same mean speed and wind energy as the observed MERRA data. These parameters were then scaled to match the Vaisala wind speeds assigned to each 1.2-km aliquot.

Each 1.2-km BOEM aliquot grid cell was assigned a mean wind speed that corresponds to the nearest 2-km WIND Toolkit grid cell representing the majority of its area. The Weibull parameters were estimated by computing the parameters of a Weibull distribution that has the same mean speed and wind energy as the WIND Toolkit data. This process created a long-term, monthly, and hourly (by month and for the whole 7-year period) Weibull representation of the wind speed for each aliquot. The resulting dataset is intended to provide broad estimates of wind speed variation for the purposes of identifying possible good wind energy sites. It is not intended to provide estimates of possible energy production for the purpose of making offshore wind project investment or financing decisions in specific locations.<BR><BR>Explanation of Attributes: Results in the geodatabase are reported on the existing 1.2 km x 1.2 km aliquot grid defined by BOEM for the Pacific coastal region. Wind speed statistics are reported at the center point of each aliquot grid, but represent the mean values over the entire area of each grid cell. The data set delivered to BOEM is a geodatabase consisting of 14 layers. There is one layer for the long-term statistics, one layer for each month, and one polygon layer of aliquots covered by the data. The long-term shapefile includes mean wind speed and Weibull parameters to capture the long-term wind speed distribution of the entire 7-year time series. Each monthly shapefile contains mean wind speed and Weibull parameters for that month overall and for each hour of the day within that month. All times are in PST (UTC-8).<BR><BR>Source: National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 15013 Denver West Parkway, Golden, CO 80401. Phone: 303-275-3000.
