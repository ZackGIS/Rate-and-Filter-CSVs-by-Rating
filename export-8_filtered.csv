DNR/ISJ_Data,https://gis.in.gov/ArcGIS/rest/services/DNR/ISJ_Data/MapServer,Map Service,"Indiana,Indiana various layers,EnergyAtlas,DNR","The Non-Levee Embankment project is a joint effort between The Indiana Silver Jackets, The Polis Center, IMAGIS/Indy GIS, INDNR and SIU Geography. The purpose of the project is to identify non-levee embankments (NLE) utilizing LiDAR and geoprocessing techniques. NLE are elevated linear features adjacent to waterways and within the floodplain. These are typically related to agriculture (farmers attempting to protect their fields from flooding) or transport (elevated road and highway banks), and have an effect on the movement and expansion of waterways. By identifying these features potentially detrimental effects resulting from reduced storage capacity and increased downstream flooding can be assessed and mitigated.The NLE's in this data set were mapped using funding from the Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs. Only 82 of the 92 counties in Indiana were eligible for inclusion in this mapping effort. The counties that were NOT mapped as part of this program include LaGrange, Steuben, Miami, Wells, Warren, Clinton, Howard, Tipton, Blackford, and Delaware. For the eligible counties, the NLE’s were identified and mapped in areas that weredefined using the statewide DFIRM (Floodplains_FIRM_IDNR_IN) from Indiana Map published on 2/10/2014. The 100 year flood zone was extracted from the overall file. The 100 year layer was dissolved and the buffered 100 feet to account for known levees that may have resulted in DFIRM boundary adjustments.

Note: The ground control survey performed to support the Orthophotography and LiDAR data used the NAD 1983 NSRS2007 (ftUS) projection. To facilitate usability by multiple software versions the Orthophotography and LiDAR is only referenced to NAD 83, and the file projection/header information was written to the files using ERDAS IMAGINE.",https://gis1.acimap.us/projectservices/rest/services/Imagery/AERIALS_2012/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable vailability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. This product is 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP). The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83.

The 1990 KLCP database depicts 10 general land cover classes for the State of Kansas. The database was compiled from a digital classification of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. The update version differs from the original release in four ways. First, the data format for the original release was an ArcInfo coverage, while the update release is an ArcInfo GRID. Second, the original's projection was Geographic with NAD83 datum. The update's projection is Albers Conic Equal Area with NAD83 datum. Third, the coding scheme for land cover classes was changed to match the coding scheme used in the 2005 Kansas Land Cover Patterns database. Fourth, an additional generalization procedure that was utilized for the 2005 KLCP database was applied to the 1990 KLCP database (see addendum to Process Description). This update facilitates comparing the 1990 KLCP dataset to the 2005 KLCP dataset on a more equal basis.",http://kars.ku.edu/arcgis/rest/services/KansasLandCover/1990KansasLandCover_Level_1/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,geology,7,imagery

Note that while the processing occurred during the 2007-2009 period, all satellite data used in the project was acquired in 2005. Concurrent with mapping the state of Kansas, the Kansas River Watershed was also mapped. The Kansas River Watershed extends into southern Nebraska and includes a portion of eastern Colorado. During Phase I a Modified Level I map was produced. In Phase II a series of maps, Modified Level II through IV, were produced. All KLCP 2005 map products were produced at four spatial extents: the state of Kansas plus a 300 meter buffer, a DEM-derived watershed boundary of the Kansas River, the Kansas River watershed boundary plus a 1,000 meter buffer, and a combined dataset of the state of Kansas plus 300 meter buffer and the watershed plus 1,000 meter buffer.These extents are annotated in the file names with the extentions k, w, wb, and kwb respectively.<BR><BR>The goal of Phase II was to map subclasses for grassland and cropland, classes which were mapped during Phase I. For the Level II map, cool- and warm-season grasslands were mapped along with Spring Crop, Summer Crop, Alfalfa, Fallow, and Double-Crop classes. For the Level III map, the Summer Crop subclasses Corn, Soybean, and Sorghum were mapped, and the Spring Crop class was reassigned to Winter Wheat. In the Level IV map, irrigation status was mapped and added to the Level III crop type map.The Kansas Land Cover Patterns Level IV map contains twenty-four land use/land cover classes and has a positional accuracy and spatial resolution appropriate for producing 1:50,000 scale maps. The minimum map unit (MMU) varies by land cover class and ranges from 0.22 to 5.12 acres.<BR><BR>In general, the mapping methodology used a hybrid, hierarchical classification of multi-temporal, multi-resolution imagery to develop modified Anderson Level II through Anderson Level IV land cover maps of the Kansas River Watershed and the State of Kansas. More specifically, multi-seasonal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the 2004 and 2005 growing season was used to map the grassland subclasses (cool- and warm-season grasslands). while MODIS NDVI time-series imagery from the 2005 growing season was used to map cropland subclasses.<BR><BR>The land use/land cover classes in the Level IV map are coded hierarchically to allow aggregation of land use and land cover classes as needed by the end-user. For example, a user can aggregate the Level IV map classes to a Level III classification by ignoring or eliminating the last digit of each land use/land cover class. Likewise, a Level II and Level I map can be created from the Level IV map by eliminating the last two and three digits, respectively, from each Level IV land use/land cover class.<BR><BR>A formal accuracy assessment found the Level II, Level III, and Level IV maps to have overall accuracy levels of 86.3%, 82.0%, and 74.3%, respectively. User and Producer (per-class errors of commission and omission) accuracies vary by land cover class and users are encouraged to reference the reported accuracy levels in the final report and/or metadata when using the Kansas Land Cover Patterns map series.

KansasPlayas/LIDARPotentialPlayaAreas,http://kars.ku.edu/arcgis/rest/services/KansasPlayas/LIDARPotentialPlayaAreas/MapServer,Map Service,"Kansas,University of Kansas - Applied Remote Sensing (KARS),EnergyAtlas,KansasPlayas","Keywords: LiDAR, Playa, PLJV probable playa, Potential playa area, PPA, Topographic Wetland Identification Process, TWIP, Wetlands<BR><BR>Kansas Playas<BR><BR>Prior to European settlement in the 1800s, the Kansas landscape was home to thousands of wetlands. In addition to providing habitat, sustenance and freshwater to indigenous and migratory wildlife, wetlands naturally provide additional services including surface water treatment, groundwater recharge and flood mitigation. While many Kansas wetlands remain intact, most have been altered through cultivation and other landscape and drainage modifications, and as a consequence, their ecological and hydrological functions have been compromised. Recent recognition and appreciation of the vital services provided by wetlands, from playa wetlands in the west to emergent wetlands in the east, has led to increased efforts within the state to study, preserve and restore these important native landscape features.<BR>The Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS) Program at the Kansas Biological Survey (KBS) has been involved in multiple recent efforts with the Kansas Water Office (KWO) to develop a current inventory of potential wetland areas (PWA) in Kansas. Identifying PWAs supports multiple initiatives in the Kansas Water Plan directly related to water conservation, water quality, recreational function and sustainability. The identification, monitoring, preservation and restoration of wetlands across the state will help maximize the ecological and hydrological services wetland communities provide to Kansans.<BR>Playas, which are sometimes associated with “buffalo wallows” from the frontier days, serve as biodiversity hotspots across the semi-arid Central and Southern High Plains. In western Kansas, where rapid, irrigation-driven decline in groundwater levels of the High Plains Aquifer is posing a formidable problem for future water supply, playas are being examined as hotspots for aquifer recharge. About 85% of the 22,000 features comprising the Kansas portion of the Playa Lakes Joint Venture probable playa (PLJV-PP) dataset have been completely farmed over, inhibiting their ecological and hydrological functionality. <BR>In 2013, KWO and KBS received EPA Wetland Program Development Grant funding to utilize newly available high resolution LiDAR elevation data to identify and map potential playa areas (PPA) in western Kansas. A second objective was to develop a playa catchment mapping procedure, which was applied to PPAs and also to PLJV-PPs in the study area. To map PPAs, the Topographic Wetland Identification Process (TWIP) tool was adapted for playa mapping. This effort was further supported through the development of elevation data preparation procedures designed to facilitate playa identification and playa catchment estimation. This web mapping application and feature service results from this research. Additional information is provided in KBS Report #186 (https://biosurvey.ku.edu/sites/biosurvey.ku.edu/files/publishedworks/pdfs/KBSrpt186.pdf).<BR>From this project, KBS identified more than 2,000 previously unmapped PPAs across an area containing about 40% of the PLJV dataset. With LiDAR data now available for all of western Kansas, KBS is pursuing opportunities to continue the mapping effort and complete the state’s playa inventory. In addition, KBS is seeking to expand collection efforts for physical and biological field data from Kansas playas, with plans to geospatially analyze these data to characterize similarities and differences in ecological functionality and services between different playa sub-populations situated throughout western Kansas.

The TWIP ArcGIS toolbox runs on individual 12-digit HUCs. LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) (2-m) were the primary data source to map all depressions or sinks in the landscape and to derive terrain analysis data layers (i.e., slope, flow direction and flow accumulation). Using flow accumulation and slope, the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) was calculated with depressions having a relatively high flow accumulation and low slope to have an increased likelihood of being actual wetlands. A map of potential wetland areas was derived by extracting depressions or sinks with a high TWI. Using Depth To Flood (DTF) values generated by the Floodplain (FLDPLN) model was used to map “mudflat wetlands” that are present in stream reaches flowing into reservoirs and large lakes. Additional landscape context information, in the form of geodatabase attributes, were generated using a set of ancillary GIS data layers. The ancillary GIS data layers include a 10-meter buffered road network, a 1-meter buffered drainage network and water body data set (extracted from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), land cover 2005 Kansas Land Cover Patterns database and wetness maps derived from Landsat TM imagery. Each contextual layer was intersected with the PWA layer and attributes indicate if an individual PWA polygon intersects with the contextual features.
