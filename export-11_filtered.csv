An isostatic residual gravity grid was derived from the complete Bouguer gravity anomaly data by removing the gravitational effect of the compensating mass that supports topographic loads. The thickness of this compensating mass was calculated using averaged digital topography by assuming a crustal thickness for sea-level topography of 25 km, a crustal density of 2.67 gm/cc, and a density contrast between the crust and upper mantle of 0.40 gm/cc. The anomalies and patterns on the map reveal features of subsurface geology, including the location of buried faults, sedimentary basins, plutons, uplifted basement rocks, and so forth. The more positive anomalies (red colors) delineate rocks more dense than the Bouguer reduction density of 2.67 gm/cc, whereas the more negative anomalies (blue colors) result from rocks of lower density.

Mine and prospect-related symbols, such as those used to represent prospect pits, mines, adits, dumps, tailings, etc., hereafter referred to as “mine” symbols or features, are currently being digitized on a state-by-state basis from the 7.5-minute (1:24,000-scale) and the 15-minute (1:48,000 and 1:62,500-scale) archive of the USGS Historical Topographic Maps Collection, or acquired from available databases (California and Nevada, 1:24,000-scale only). Compilation of these features is the first phase in capturing accurate locations and general information about features related to mineral resource exploration and extraction across the U.S. To date, the compilation of 637,000-plus point and polygon mine symbols from approximately 88,000 maps across 35 states has been completed: Alabama (AL), Arizona (AZ), Arkansas (AR), California (CA), Colorado (CO), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Idaho (ID), Iowa (IA), Illinois (IL), Indiana (IN), Kansas (KS), Kentucky (KY), Louisiana (LA), Michigan (MI), Minnesota (MN), Mississippi (MS), Missouri (MO), Montana (MT), North Carolina (NC), North Dakota (ND), Nebraska (NE), New Mexico (NM), Nevada (NV), Oklahoma (OK), Ohio (OH), Oregon (OR), South Carolina (SC), South Dakota (SD), Tennessee (TN), Texas (TX), Utah (UT), Washington (WA), Wisconsin (WI), and Wyoming (WY). The process renders not only a more complete picture of exploration and mining in the U.S., but an approximate time line of when these activities occurred. The data may be used for land use planning, assessing abandoned mine lands and mine-related environmental impacts, assessing the value of mineral resources from Federal, State and private lands, and mapping mineralized areas and systems for input into the land management process.

Quantifying methane emissions is critical for projecting and mitigating changes to climate and air quality. Here we present CH4 observations made from space combined with Earth‐based remote sensing column measurements. Results indicate the largest anomalous CH4 levels viewable from space over the conterminous U.S. are located at the Four Corners region in the Southwest U.S. Emissions exceeding inventory estimates, totaling 0.59 Tg CH4/yr [0.50–0.67; 2σ], are necessary to bring high‐resolution simulations and observations into agreement. This underestimated source approaches 10% of the EPA estimate of total U.S. CH4 emissions from natural gas. The persistence of this CH4 signal from 2003 onward indicates that the source is likely from established gas, coal, and coalbed methane mining and processing. This work demonstrates that space‐based observations can identify anomalous CH4 emission source regions and quantify their emissions with the use of a transport model.",https://arcgis.env.nm.gov/server/rest/services/oots/methane_hotspot/MapServer/info/thumbnail,methane emissions,9,emissions

The National Elevation Dataset (NED) serves the elevation layer of The National Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use NED data for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other applications. The NED is an elevation dataset that consists of seamless layers and a high resolution layer.

These data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees, and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). All elevation values are in meters and, over the continental United States, are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). The vertical reference will vary in other areas.
