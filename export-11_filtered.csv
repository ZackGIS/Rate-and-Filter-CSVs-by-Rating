Included are deposit name, location, commodity, deposit description, geologic characteristics, production, reserves, resources, and references. It subsumes the original MRDS and MAS/MILS. MRDS is large, complex, and somewhat problematic. This service provides a subset of the database comprised of those data fields deemed most useful and which most frequently contain some information, but full reports of most records are available as well.<BR><BR>Current status: As of 2011, USGS has ceased systematic updates to MRDS, and is working to create a new database, focused primarily on the conterminous US. For locations outside the United States, MRDS remains the best collection of reports that USGS has available. For locations in Alaska, the Alaska Resource Data File remains the most coherent collection of such reports and is in continuing development.<BR><BR>Resource descriptions here include an indication of the overall quantity and diversity of information they contain. Many records in this database are simple reports of commodity at some location, but some records provide substantial detail of the geological setting and industrial exploitation of the resource. To help users find these more thorough records, a map interface and search form are provided that rank results by overall quality, records graded A having more information about more aspects of the resource, records graded D having only summary information about the resource.

MineralsAndEnergy/USMIN,https://gisweb.unr.edu/nbmg/rest/services/MineralsAndEnergy/USMIN/MapServer,Map Service,"Nevada,Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology - University of Nevada,EnergyAtlas,MineralsAndEnergy","Version 4.0 of these data are part of a larger USGS project to develop an updated geospatial database of mines, mineral deposits and mineral regions in the United States. Mine and prospect-related symbols, such as those used to represent prospect pits, mines, adits, dumps, tailings, etc., hereafter referred to as “mine” symbols or features, are currently being digitized on a state-by-state basis from the 7.5-minute (1:24,000-scale) and the 15-minute (1:48,000 and 1:62,500-scale) archive of the USGS Historical Topographic Maps Collection, or acquired from available databases (California and Nevada, 1:24,000-scale only). Compilation of these features is the first phase in capturing accurate locations and general information about features related to mineral resource exploration and extraction across the U.S. To date, the compilation of 637,000-plus point and polygon mine symbols from approximately 88,000 maps across 35 states has been completed: Alabama (AL), Arizona (AZ), Arkansas (AR), California (CA), Colorado (CO), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Idaho (ID), Iowa (IA), Illinois (IL), Indiana (IN), Kansas (KS), Kentucky (KY), Louisiana (LA), Michigan (MI), Minnesota (MN), Mississippi (MS), Missouri (MO), Montana (MT), North Carolina (NC), North Dakota (ND), Nebraska (NE), New Mexico (NM), Nevada (NV), Oklahoma (OK), Ohio (OH), Oregon (OR), South Carolina (SC), South Dakota (SD), Tennessee (TN), Texas (TX), Utah (UT), Washington (WA), Wisconsin (WI), and Wyoming (WY). The process renders not only a more complete picture of exploration and mining in the U.S., but an approximate time line of when these activities occurred. The data may be used for land use planning, assessing abandoned mine lands and mine-related environmental impacts, assessing the value of mineral resources from Federal, State and private lands, and mapping mineralized areas and systems for input into the land management process. The data are presented as three groups of layers based on the scale of the source maps. No reconciliation between the data groups was done.<BR><BR>Datasets were developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Geology, Geophysics, and Geochemistry Science Center (GGGSC). Compilation work was completed by USGS student contractors: Germán Schmeda, Patrick C. Scott, William Gnesda, Margaret Hammond, Tyler Reyes, Morgan Mullins, Thomas Carroll, Margaret Brantley, and Logan Barrett; and by USGS personnel Damon Bickerstaff, Stuart A. Giles and E.G.

NHDPlus includes a stream network based on the medium resolution NHD (1:100,000-scale), improved networking, feature naming, and “value-added attributes” (VAA). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments produced using a drainage enforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed “The New-England Method.” This technique involves enforcing the 1:100,000-scale NHD drainage network by modifying the NED elevations to fit with the network via trenching and using the WBD to enforce hydrologic divides, and applying sinks in noncontributing areas.

Designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components, ecoregions denote areas of similarity in the mosaic of biotic, abiotic, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystem components with humans being considered as part of the biota. These regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across Federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernmental organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographic areas (Omernik and Griffith 2014, McMahon et al. 2001).<BR><BR>Ecoregions are identified by analyzing the patterns and composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Omernik 1987, 1995).

This underestimated source approaches 10% of the EPA estimate of total U.S. CH4 emissions from natural gas. The persistence of this CH4 signal from 2003 onward indicates that the source is likely from established gas, coal, and coalbed methane mining and processing. This work demonstrates that space‐based observations can identify anomalous CH4 emission source regions and quantify their emissions with the use of a transport model.",https://arcgis.env.nm.gov/server/rest/services/oots/methane_hotspot/MapServer/info/thumbnail,methane,8,emissions
pljv/probable_playas,https://arcgis.env.nm.gov/server/rest/services/pljv/probable_playas/MapServer,Map Service,"New Mexico,New Mexico Environment Department,EnergyAtlas,pljv","Playas are one of the most numerous wetland types in the Playa Lakes Joint Venture region. Playas are shallow, depressional wetlands that are generally round and small in size. They have clay-lined basins and naturally fill with water periodically from rainfall and its associated runoff. Precipitation is inconsistent in the PLJV region and drought is a common occurrence. The resulting wet-dry cycle of playas produces a highly diverse plant community. When wet, playas provide much needed seeds and invertebrates so migrating birds reach their breeding grounds in better condition. Likewise, birds that overwinter in the<BR>region have a better chance of success when playas are allowed to function naturally. Playa lakes may be the most important wetland habitat type for birds in this region. Playas are also a primary source of aquifer recharge.",https://arcgis.env.nm.gov/server/rest/services/pljv/probable_playas/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,7,geology
