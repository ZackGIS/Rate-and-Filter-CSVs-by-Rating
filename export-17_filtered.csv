Survey results have been summarized as presence or absence (lack of detectable) of spawn for each species and estimated length (parallel to shore) of suitable habitat (beach length). Survey effort has varied substantially since sampling began in the 1970s and site selection has been based on the presence of apparently suitable habitat, the ease of surveyor access, and site-specific construction requests. These data do not represent a uniform or representative sample of all available habitat types in the Puget Sound nearshore.Pacific sand lance and surf smelt, along with other smelts (family Osmeridae), Pacific herring (Clupea palasii), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), are collectively referred to as forage fish and are important prey for marine birds, mammals, and fish, including salmon, in Washington. Pacific sand lance and surf smelt spawn in the upper intertidal zone of beaches mostly composed of mixed sand and gravel substrates, and sometimes larger substrates. Finer-grained spawning substrates are susceptible to changes in beach sediment dynamics such as loss of source areas, interruption of along-shore transport, and increased wave energy that can reduce the suitability of available habitat.

WVWRAM is a standardized protocol for rapidly assessing the functions, services, values, and condition of wetlands. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) developed this method in coordination with the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR), with funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Wetland Program Development program. WVWRAM scores are designed to answer the following questions: • How effective is the wetland in improving water quality downstream, including sediment retention, nutrient processing, and pollutant removal? • How effective is the wetland in slowing and storing flood waters and providing base flow to streams? • How effective is the wetland in providing wildlife habitat and maintaining biodiversity and ecological integrity? • What is the current quality or condition of the wetland? Detailed information about WVWRAM is available in the Watershed Assessment Branch section of the WVDEP website. Fields Acres: Number of acres in the wetland, as per West Virginia Wetland Inventory Mapping. THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ACREAGE AND DOES NOT REPLACE THE REQUIREMENT FOR DELINEATION OF WETLANDS THAT ENTER THE REGULATORY PROCESS. RegPrelim: The preliminary GIS regulatory score is used for planning purposes only. THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL REGULATORY SCORE AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN WEST VIRGINIA. This score represents a preliminary estimate of the physical, biological, and chemical functions of the wetland. The WVWRAM method requires a rapid field assessment in addition to GIS assessment in order to calculate a final functional score. Ninety-eight percent of vegetated wetlands in West Virginia score between 0.0 - 1.0. Scores above 1.0 represent wetlands of special conservation concern. DNRLandAcq: The WVDNR land acquisition score reflects the functions and services of wetlands in terms of conservation, development, protection, enjoyment and use. This score is based on the condition of the wetland (see condition score below) plus the “Value to Society” metrics for all functions. Condition: The condition score is calculated from the intrinsic potential portion of the water quality, flood attenuation, and habitat/ecological integrity metrics, plus the landscape opportunity portion of the habitat/ecological integrity metrics. The maximum score is 176. Note that >99% of scores fall in the range 0-76; scores above 76 represent wetlands of special conservation concern. BRank: Site Biodiversity Rank based on WVDNR Natural Heritage data on documented occurrences of rare wetland species and high-quality natural communities or species assemblages, including their state and global conservation status rank, occurrence quality rank, and concentrations of rare elements. Site Biodiversity Ranks (B-ranks) are designated as: B1 Outstanding Global Biodiversity Significance B2 High Global Biodiversity Significance B3 Global Biodiversity Significance B4 Outstanding State Biodiversity Significance B5 State Biodiversity Significance B6 Local Biodiversity Significance WetlCode: Unique identifier for mapped wetland complexes in the West Virginia Wetlands Inventory.”",https://tagis.dep.wv.gov/arcgis/rest/services/app_services/wetland_function_2019_wm/MapServer/info/thumbnail,environmental,7,environmental

The land cover data are best utilized at approximate map scales of 1:48,000 to 1:500,000, and at no less than a 2 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU). <BR><BR>Overall accuracy for the Level 4 classification is estimated at 66% across all classes.

The NAIP 2020 aerial photography is natural color, leaf-on, 0.6-meter resolution imagery. The image service has also been supplemented with 2021 NAIP imagery for MN and IA counties that lie along Wisconsin's western boundary. <BR><BR>WI DNR acknowledges the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service for making source data available.
