The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer. The 2017 CDL has a ground resolution of 30 meters. The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) DEIMOS-1 and UK2 sensors collected during the current growing season. Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED) and the imperviousness and canopy data layers from the USGS National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011).

TidalStream/usa_mc_tides,https://geospat.gatech.edu/arcgis/rest/services/TidalStream/usa_mc_tides/MapServer,Map Service,"Georgia,Georgia Tech,EnergyAtlas,TidalStream","Tidal streams are high velocity sea currents created by periodic horizontal movement of the tides, often magnified by local topographical features such as headlands, inlets to inland lagoons, and straits. As tides ebb and flow, currents are often generated in coastal waters. In many places the shape of the seabed forces water to flow through narrow channels, or around headlands. Tidal stream energy extraction is derived from the kinetic energy of the moving flow; analogous to the way a wind turbine operates in air, and as such differs from tidal barrages, which relies on providing a head of water for energy extraction. A tidal stream energy converter extracts and converts the mechanical energy in the current into a transmittable energy form. A variety of conversion devices are currently being proposed or are under active development, from a water turbine similar to a scaled wind turbine, driving a generator via a gearbox, to an oscillating hydrofoil which drives a hydraulic motor.<BR><BR>More info @ http://www.tidalstreampower.gatech.edu/documentation.htm<BR>http://www.tidalstreampower.gatech.edu/Final_Report_tidal_v2.pdf",https://geospat.gatech.edu/arcgis/rest/services/TidalStream/usa_mc_tides/MapServer/info/thumbnail,renewables,8,renewables

Due to flight restrictions around airports and military bases, some areas of the coastline were omitted. The dataset covers an approximate 200m swath, with a variable amount of shoreline and nearshore water, and was processed into tiles of orthoimagery for GIS analysis of marine debris. Brian Neilson (Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources; Brian.J.Neilson@hawaii.gov) was the Principal Investigator on the “Hawaiian islands marine debris aerial imagery surveys” component of the PICES Project “Effects of marine debris caused by the Great Tsunami of 2011” funded by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan. The project coordinator was Dr. Alexander Bychkov (bychkov@pices.int). In 2020, Ross Winans (winans2@hawaii.edu) enhanced the imagery by: removing excessive no-data (including cropping out areas of no-data in some images); creating alpha masks with GINA's gdal_trace_outline for transparency since the data uses ""0"" and ""255"" for valid data; for areas in the data where places were ""patched"" with a second, overlapping image swath at a later date, the image that best aligned with the GIS labeled marine debris objects described in Moy et al. (2018) were chosen and the unused overlap was cropped out, resulting in a data set that is now tiled edge-to-edge with no overlap. For further information, please contact the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program at gis@hawaii.gov.

Use of this product for Commercial Purposes by a person/company/organization for a profit or fee is strictly prohibited. Digital orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a digital image with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary dynamic digital orthophoto is a 30-50 centimeter ground resolution, image cast to the customer specified projection and datum defined in the Spatial Reference Information section of this metadata document. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and ensure full coverage if the imagery is reprojected. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns).

NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides four main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters of reference DOQQs; 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 6 meters to true ground; and, 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies who use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment. With an annual cycle, NAIP is also used for disaster response often providing the most current pre-event imagery. While suitable for a variety of uses the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery is primarily intended to assess crop condition and compliance to USDA farm program conditions. The 2 meter imagery is generally acquired only for agricultural areas within state projects.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>",https://insideidaho.org/arcgis/rest/services/imagery/southeastidaho_2003/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

In regions that have a cover of Pleistocene glacial drift, the map uses the surface of the unconformity between the drift and the bedrock surface.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. Digital wetlands data are intended for use with base maps and digital aerial photography at a scale of 1:12,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary intended use is for regional and watershed data display and analysis, rather than specific project data analysis.
