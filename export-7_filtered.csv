TidalStream/usa_mc_tides,https://geospat.gatech.edu/arcgis/rest/services/TidalStream/usa_mc_tides/MapServer,Map Service,"Georgia,Georgia Tech,EnergyAtlas,TidalStream","Tidal streams are high velocity sea currents created by periodic horizontal movement of the tides, often magnified by local topographical features such as headlands, inlets to inland lagoons, and straits. As tides ebb and flow, currents are often generated in coastal waters. In many places the shape of the seabed forces water to flow through narrow channels, or around headlands. Tidal stream energy extraction is derived from the kinetic energy of the moving flow; analogous to the way a wind turbine operates in air, and as such differs from tidal barrages, which relies on providing a head of water for energy extraction. A tidal stream energy converter extracts and converts the mechanical energy in the current into a transmittable energy form. A variety of conversion devices are currently being proposed or are under active development, from a water turbine similar to a scaled wind turbine, driving a generator via a gearbox, to an oscillating hydrofoil which drives a hydraulic motor.<BR><BR>More info @ http://www.tidalstreampower.gatech.edu/documentation.htm<BR>http://www.tidalstreampower.gatech.edu/Final_Report_tidal_v2.pdf",https://geospat.gatech.edu/arcgis/rest/services/TidalStream/usa_mc_tides/MapServer/info/thumbnail,tidal energy,8,renewables
