Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Ortho Specification, Version 1.0. The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) California State Plane Coordinate System, Zone 4, US Survey Feet. Orthoimagery data were delivered as stereo imagery pairs in GeoTIFF format, 131 individual 0.25-foot 2,640 feet x 2,640 feet 8-bit, 4-band (RGBN) GeoTIFF tiles, and a 0.25-foot 8-bit, 4-band (RGBN) 20:1 compressed MrSID mosaic. Ground Conditions: Aerial photography was captured during the summer of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the imagery data to meet task order specifications and meet horizontal accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 16 surveyed control points throughout the project area to assess the horizontal accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>",https://giswebservices.ci.salinas.ca.us/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/Aerial_2018_SID/MapServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,10,imagery
