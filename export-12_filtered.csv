The project encompassed an area of approximately 197 square miles. A Leica ADS40 Digital Camera system including an inertial measuring unit (IMU) and a dual frequency airborne GPS receiver was used for the digital image acquisition. Imagery acquisition was performed on April 17th and April 22nd of 2005 at 4800' AMT. Ground control survey was conducted by Kadrmas, Lee and Jackson of Bismarck, North Dakota. A survey report summarizing methodology and results was submitted in hardcopy and a digital file in PDF format. GPS data was collected on two new monuments and 11 existing MPO monuments. The resulting coordinates for each new station are referenced to NAD 83(96) datum in North Dakota State Coordinate System, South Zone (3302). The horizontal units were international feet. The GPS Orthometric Heights were determined by calculating the Ellipsoid-Geoid separation using Geoid 99 model and are based on NGVD 1929 international feet. The existing DTM data which Horizons had collected in 2001 was updated to support 2' contours where requested. New mapping was performed on 40 sections and an additional 30 sections of DTM collection was done for ortho rectification only. Contour were generated from the updated and new DTM data and delivered in ARC Shape file format in one contiguous file. The DTM data including breaklines, random points and spot elevation points were also delivered in ARC Shape file format. Color digital orthophotos in TIFF format with .TWF files were produced with a resolution of 6"" utilizing the ADS40 imagery and the updated DTM. </SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>",https://ndgishub.nd.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/AerialImage_BisMan_2005/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

The NAIP acquires 4 band digital ortho imagery from airborne and/or space based platforms during the agricultural growing seasons in the U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within sixty days of acquisition. The NAIP provides 60 centimeter ground sampel distance ortho imagery rectified within +/- 4 meters to true ground at a 95% confidence level. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 (plus or minus 30) pixel buffer on all four sides.

In 2008, the Bureau of Reclamation’s Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Group (RSGIG) in collaboration with the Bureau of Land Management Miles City Field Office mapped sagebrush and other land cover in a study area in and around the Cedar Creek Anticline within the Williston Basin. The study area fell within portions of NW South Dakota, SW North Dakota and SE Montana representing approximately 1,132,000 acres. The project utilized the recently developed methodology of combining high resolution multi-band color infrared digital imagery along with object oriented image processing for the identification and mapping of sagebrush over a large area in a cost effective manner. The objective of the project was to cost effectively collect and analyze imagery to determine the extent of sagebrush vegetation communities at a level of detail to assess vegetation community relationships. The costs incurred by using the methodology represented in this project to map 10 land classes have been estimated at $.40 to $.80 per-acre compared to the $2.00 to $3.00 per-acre using traditional methodologies.</span></p></div></div></div>",https://ndgishub.nd.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/AerialImage_SouthWest_2007_CIR/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

The aerial imagery was collected on April 10 using a Leica DMC III sensor mounted in a fixed-wing aircraft equipped with Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU) and Airborne GPS. Aerial imagery was collected to support 0.25 foot ground sample distance (GSD) orthoimagery to meet the National Mapping Accuracy Standard (NMAS) for 1""=50' scale mapping. The horizontal accuracy meets or exceeds NMAS requirements, stating that 90% of all test points be within 1/30th of an inch at mapping scale. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to a DEM surface created from new LiDAR data acquired in 2021. Orthoimagery was delivered in PLSS quarter section GeoTIFF, ECW, and MrSID tiles and a project-wide ECW and MrSID mosaic. Additional Information: The Grand Forks – East Grand Forks Metropolitan Planning Organization is a certified planning entity in the State of North Dakota and Minnesota and is comprised of the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks. The purpose of the MPO is to provide a forum for public officials, citizens, and other interested groups to establish policies and plans for effectively addressing various metropolitan transportation issues. The MPO has a planning process that supports metropolitan community development and social goals. These plans and programs shall lead to the development of an integrated, inter-modal metropolitan transportation system that facilitates the efficient, economic movement of people and goods.",https://www.gfgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/AerialImagery/GrandForksOrtho2021/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery
