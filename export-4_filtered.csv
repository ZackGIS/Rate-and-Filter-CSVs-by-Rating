Two habitat classes are included in the dataset: wetland features commonly associated with the surface expression of groundwater under natural, unmodified conditions; and vegetation types commonly associated with the sub-surface presence of groundwater (phreatophytes). The NCCAG dataset began as an amalgamation of vegetation and wetland datasets with different scales, resolutions, attribute details, and classifications. A working group comprised of DWR, California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) further reviewed the vegetation and wetland datasets and conducted a screening process to identify the vegetation and wetland types considered to be commonly associated with groundwater (Klausmeyer et al., 2018). The NCCAG dataset can be used as a starting point to investigate and identify groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) within a groundwater basin. Identifying GDEs requires detailed understanding of the land use, groundwater levels, hydrology, and geology of a location. This comprehensive understanding of geology, hydrology, and biology is not available at the statewide scale.

The 2017 polygons are digitized from the 2017 Delta LiDAR imagery by the Division of Engineering, Geomatics Branch, Geospatial Data Support Section. The older pre-2017 polygons were all digitized by staff in the Delta Levees Program. Data can be queried for a single year or date range using the 'Year' field. Historical data was compiled and merged from datasets provided by the Delta Levees program. Data coverage differs between years. Absences or gaps in historical data may occur. Older acquisitions generally have a smaller footprint than recent imagery acquisitions. The 2017 in-channel islands cover the Legal Delta, and also include Chipps Island.
