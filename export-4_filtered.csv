A determination of the total sandy beach area retained by each structure was based on fillets or salients that are visible in aerial imagery and on the pre-post construction shoreline positions in the proximity of each structure.The lifespans of coastal stabilization, beach restoration and beach nourishment projects may be extended by the presence of man-made structures that act as barriers to littoral drift.

The Land IQ base data was reviewed, and in some cases revised, by DWR Regional Office Land Use staff using additional analyses based on a combination of aerial photography, remote sensing multi-spectral imagery, agronomic analysis and ground verification. Revised crops and conditions were encoded using standard DWR land use codes added to feature attributes, and each modified classification is indicated by the value 'r' in the 'DWR_revised' data field. Each polygon classification is consistent with DWR attribute standards, however some of DWR's traditional attribute definitions are modified and extended to accomodate unavoidable constraints within remote-sensing classifications, or to make data more specific for DWR's water balance computation needs.
