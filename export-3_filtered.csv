The land cover data available for the entire continent are too coarse (250 m to 1 km) for resource managers, government and non-government organizations, and Earth scientists to develop conservation strategies, formulate resource management options, and monitor land cover dynamics. We used Landsat 30 m satellite data of 2010 and prepared the land cover database of South America using state-of-the-science remote sensing techniques. We produced regionally consistent and locally relevant land cover information by processing a large volume of data covering the entire continent. Our analysis revealed that in 2010, 50% of South America was covered by forests, 2.5% was covered by water, and 0.02% was covered by snow and ice. The percent forest area of South America varies from 9.5% in Uruguay to 96.5% in French Guiana. We used very high resolution (<5 m) satellite data to validate the land cover product. The overall accuracy of the 2010 South American 30-m land cover map is 89% with a Kappa coefficient of 79%. Accuracy of barren areas needs to improve possibly using multi-temporal Landsat data. An update of land cover and change database of South America with additional land cover classes is needed.

The trajectory model, which uses existing meteorological forecast fields from regional or global models to compute advection (i.e., the rate of change of an atmospheric property caused by the horizontal movement of air) and stability, is designed to support a wide range of simulations related to the atmospheric transport of pollutants. <BR><BR>While HYSPLIT is a useful tool for identifying meteorological patterns associated with exceedance events, HYSPLIT trajectories alone do not conclusively indicate contribution to measured high concentrations of ozone. Therefore, they cannot be used in isolation to determine inclusion or exclusion of an area within a nonattainment boundary. While a HYSPLIT trajectory analysis alone cannot yield a conclusion that a particular region contributes to ozone concentrations, it may be conceivable that a set of HYSPLIT trajectories that show no wind flow from a particular region on any day with high ozone concentration measurements might support discounting that region as contributing to ozone concentrations. <BR><BR>A HYSPLIT backward trajectory, the most common trajectory used in assessments associated with determining nonattainment area boundaries, is usually depicted on a standard map as a single line extending in two dimensional (x,y) space from a starting point, regressing backward in time as the line extends from the starting point. An individual trajectory can have only one starting height; HYSPLIT can plot trajectories of different starting heights using different colors. The line thickness is predetermined as a user option, so it does not imply coverage other than to represent the centerline of an air parcel’s motion calculated to arrive at the starting location at the starting time.<BR><BR>In this tool, three starting heights are plotted -- 100m AGL (red), 500m (blue), and 1000m (green) – for each ozone monitor with a design value greater than 70ppb for each day that monitor’s daily maximum 8-hour average ozone value exceeded 70ppb.

A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of six common air pollutants known as criteria pollutants. After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as “attainment” (meeting), “nonattainment” (not meeting), or “unclassifiable” (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. Air Quality Systems (AQS) 2012-2014 Design Value Data - as of October 1, 2015.

We are working to include additional data sources, such as Landsat and radar, to improve coverage and accuracy.<BR><BR>This work builds on the long-time expertise and efforts of the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) to map floodwater extent in detail for active floods. The DFO website provides additional detail, additional products, and archives of historical flood maps. This NASA website provides links and information about the automated daily flood and surface water products produced at NASA Goddard.<BR><BR>Note:<BR><BR>The MODIS Flood 3 Day Image Service is the representing the MODIS Water Product (combines both MFW and MSW, raster only). There is no indication provided of where there is insufficient clear data in the given product to determine water extent. Thus, these products only indicate where water has been detected, but the absence of a water polygon cannot be interpreted to mean there was no water present in a given area; it may simply have been sufficiently cloudy over the composite period for the required number of water observations to be met (the Y in composite indicator XDYO). The MWP product (below) attempts to address this deficiency, and may eventually replace MFW and MSW. These vector products can also be extremely resource intensive to generate from the source raster; a partly cloudy scene over water, or a tile over mountains with terrain shadow issues, can have tens of thousands of polygons, if we were to convert to shapefile or KMZ. Thus, we typically skip vector product generation if the number of polygons is greater than 20000. Currently delivered only in geotiff raster format.<BR><BR>We detect water using an algorithm developed by Bob Brakenridge of the Dartmouth Flood Observatory. This algorithm uses a ratio of MODIS Band 1 and Band 2, and a threshold on Band 7 to provisionally identify pixels as water. We then composite the water detections over the product window (2 days, typically). If a pixel is identified as water over several (2 or more) observations during the product window, it is then definitively marked as water, and output in the MSW, or ""MODIS Surface Water"" product. 2 (or more) observations are required because cloud shadow can appear quite spectrally similar to water.<BR><BR>In cases where cloud shadow occurs in the same spot in 2 observations, the product may incorrectly flag such areas as water. A 3 observation requirement helps further, but also increases latency of the product. At the moment, we are using the 2 observation requirement as a balance between accuracy and timeliness. Finally, the detected water is compared to a reference water layer that shows ""normal"" water extent, and any pixels found outside the normal water extent are marked as flood, and output in the MFW (""MODIS Flood Water"") products.<BR><BR>The Image Service is published using a Raster Mosaic populated with “MWP” GeoTiffs collected from the NRT Global Flood Mapping Data Viewer site.<BR><BR>Data Visualization:<BR><BR>MODIS Flood layer is represented using Unique Values Ranging from 0-3.<BR><BR>0 : Insufficient data to make water determination (cloudy, missing images, swath gaps, or bad data values).<BR><BR>1 : No water detected.<BR><BR>2 : Water detected AND coinciding with reference water (e.g., not flood).<BR><BR>3 : Water detected, beyond reference water, so may be flood.<BR><BR>Update Frequency:<BR><BR>Daily<BR><BR>Suggested Usage:<BR><BR>Flood detection and showing areas of surface water inundation.<BR><BR>Further Reference:<BR><BR>Learn more about MODIS Flood Products<BR><BR>Purpose/Summary:<BR><BR>Flood Detection Map, MODIS Flood 1 Day (1D1OS), Updated Daily",https://maps.disasters.nasa.gov/ags03/rest/services/ca_flooding_201902/modis_1dayfloodmap_20190228/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

This false-color map shows the amount of permanent surface movement caused almost entirely by the earthquake, as viewed by the satellite, during a 70-day interval between two ALOS-2 images acquired on February 21 and May 2, 2015. <BR><BR>In the map, surface displacements are seen as color contours (or ""fringes""), where each color cycle represents 4.7 inches (11.9 centimeters) of surface motion. The contours show the land around Kathmandu has moved toward the satellite by up to 4.6 feet (1.4 meter), or 5.2 feet (1.6 meters) if we assume purely vertical motion. Areas without the color contours have snow or heavy vegetation that affects the radar measurements. Scientists use these maps to build detailed models of the fault and associated land movements to better understand the impact on future earthquake activity.

This false color map can be used to define the extent of ash fall and pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) in a volcanic eruption event. This image is a false-color composite (Red, Green, Blue band combinations) for La Soufrière. The band combination was created using a pair of pre- and post-eruption Sentinel-1 VV polarization amplitude images. This is used to emphasize the changes in amplitude signal over time: • Red channel: pre-eruption amplitude image• Green channel: post-eruption amplitude image• Blue channel: ratio of post-eruption amplitude image divided by pre-eruption amplitude imageThis band combination provides a legend, in which the red colored pixels indicate signal loss from reduced surface roughness, whereas the blue color indicates signal gain from increased surface roughness, and yellow is for surfaces where the intensity signal did not change.The interpretation here is that the infilling of the valleys by thick concentrated pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) reduce surface roughness, seen in dark red colored pixels in the valleys to the W and SW of the volcano. Partial vegetation stripping and deposition of thinner, yet ash-rich deposits, result in a milder increase in surface roughness seen with lighter red pixels near the summit to the NE. Inside the summit crater, the destruction of both the old and the new lava domes during the successive explosions resulted in significant morphological changes, which in turn cause increased amplitude signal due to increased surface roughness indicated by bright blue pixels.Suggested Use:In this RGB composite, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) appear in dark red, dilute PDCs or ash/tephra fall in light red, surface morphology change in bright blue. At the summit, the areas in blue denote destruction of both old and new lava domes. The areas in yellow indicate little to no change.

The MWP product (below) attempts to address this deficiency, and may eventually replace MFW and MSW. These vector products can also be extremely resource intensive to generate from the source raster; a partly cloudy scene over water, or a tile over mountains with terrain shadow issues, can have tens of thousands of polygons, if we were to convert to shapefile or KMZ.

GLS datasets are created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using Landsat images. This service can be used for mapping and change detection of snow, change of natural resources and comparing Landsat 8 imagery with GLS data. Using on-the-fly processing, the raw DN values are transformed to scaled (0- 10000) apparent reflectance values and then different service based renderings for band combinations and indices are applied. The band names are in line with Landsat 8 bands; GLS data band names are mapped along the same lines. The service is updated on daily basis to include scenes from the USGS.

Commonly referred to as ""the Plafker map"", this publication is out of print and was used as baseline information for the creation of the Quaternary fault and fold database for Alaska (Koehler and others, 2012).<BR>The fault and fold database published by Koehler and others (2012) incorporates research carried out over the 20 years since publication of the original Plafker map and makes the results available in digital form. Koehler and others (2012) digitized Quaternary faults and folds from original sources at their original scales; their publication thus represents a more accurate depiction of the Quaternary traces shown on the Plafker map. Sheet 1 of Koehler and others (2012) includes the pre-Quaternary traces from the Plafker map as a background layer to show the distribution of faults throughout the state. To assist the user community and encourage more detailed mapping and paleoseismic research, we digitized the fault and fold traces from the Plafker map and made two vector shapefiles of these structures. These files are available for download. This package includes (1) a shapefile of all structures from the Plafker map, and (2) a shapefile of only pre-Quaternary structures. Ancillary features from the Plafker map that were not digitized include volcanic rocks, active thermal springs, bathymetric contours, focal regions and epicenters of major earthquakes, and depth contours of the Pacific Plate beneath the margin of southern Alaska. The scale of the Plafker map is 1:2,500,000, thus the data are not intended for depiction on large-scale maps. For the most accurate depiction of the locations of faults and folds in Alaska, users are referred to sheet 1 of Koehler and others (2012), which presents a combined dataset of the pre-Quaternary structures of the Plafker map and the Quaternary structures of Koehler and others (2012).",https://maps.dggs.alaska.gov/arcgis/rest/services/apps/mp150_prequaternary/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,8,geology

This work considers both geothermal and fossil fuel (oil, natural gas, and coal) resources and is intended to supplement the Alaska Energy Authority’s ongoing analysis of non-geologic energy sources such as hydro, wind, and biomass. Collectively, these summaries provide a basis for ensuring that Alaska’s entire suite of potential energy sources is considered. Although this review does not represent a comprehensive analysis or resource assessment, the information should assist local, regional, and statewide efforts to reduce the dependence on diesel for heat and electricity. The potential for locally exploitable natural resources varies widely across the state, and certain regions possess more favorable geologic attributes than others. The chapters of this report are subdivided into the 11 regions recognized by the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA, 2009). For each region, discussion is provided on its potential for geologically hosted energy resources including coal, conventional and unconventional oil and gas, and geothermal resources. Many areas of the state lack sufficient geologic information to reliably evaluate local energy potential; summaries of each region conclude with recommendations regarding what additional data or strategies would be most helpful in developing new energy resources for local or regional use.",https://maps.dggs.alaska.gov/arcgis/rest/services/pub_thumbs/sr66/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,8,geology
