geology/arabian,https://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/server/rest/services/geology/arabian/MapServer,Map Service,"USGS - Other ArcGIS servers,EnergyAtlas,geology","This digital map compilation, which includes geology, geologic provinces, and oil and gas fields of the Arabian Peninsula, is part of a map series of the world produced by the U.S. Geological Survey World Energy Project. The goal of the project is to produce a worldwide assessment of the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources and report these results by the year 2000. To assess the world's petroleum, a sequence of steps is being undertaken proceeding from defining geologic provinces of the world at a comparable scale, allocating oil and gas fields to these provinces, defining petroleum systems within these provinces, and ultimately assessing the undiscovered petroleum potential of selected provinces of the world. A more in-depth discussion of the geologic provinces and their relative ranking in terms of total known petroleum volume is given in USGS Open File Report 97-463 (see Klett and others, 1997). For the World Energy assessment, the world was divided into eight energy regions which correspond approximately with the economic regions of the world as defined by the U.S. Department of State. The Arabian Peninsula portion of Region 2 is represented on this CD-ROM (see insert Reference Map on geologic map). The geology map of the Arabian Peninsula was compiled and synthesized primarily from the U.S. Geological Survey-- Arabian American Oil Company, 1963, 1:2,000,000 scale Geologic map of the Arabian Peninsula. Additional geology in the northern portion of this map for parts of Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Israel, and Lebanon was derived with permission from the 1:5,000,000 scale, 1971 version of the Geologic Map of Europe, Eastern sheet, published by UNESCO (see Selected References no.4). Specific details of the data sources are given in the metadata file on this CD-ROM. Map units were combined to simplify the map when projected at a larger scale and to maintain consistency with other region maps. Precambrian rocks are undivided and consist of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous types. The boundary for Region 2 (Middle East/North Africa) is shown as an inset on the map. Oil and gas field markers represent field centerpoints published with permission from Petroconsultants International Data Corp., 1996 database. Each region was divided into geologic provinces. Geologic province boundaries for the Arabian Peninsula were delineated onshore using data from the U.S. Geological Survey--Arabian American Oil Company, and UNESCO geologic maps (see Selected References), and other tectonic and geographical data from the publications listed in the Selected References section. Offshore geologic province boundaries are defined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour from the U.S. Geologic Survey--Arabian American Oil Company 1963 geologic map (see Selected References). Provinces may contain one dominant element or a number of contiguous elements or basins that are genetically related. Each geologic province was assigned a unique number; the first digit is the region number. An attempt was made to number the provinces in geographical order. In the Arabian Peninsula the numbering starts in the southernmost portion of the peninsula, generally increasing to the east and north. This map was compiled and displayed using Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) Arc/Info, ARCVIEW, and ArcPlot softwares. Political boundaries and their cartographic representation on this map were taken with permission from ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3,000,000 Arc/Info digital coverage, have no political significance, and are displayed as general reference only.

For this purpose, the map provides an outline of the general geographic distribution of both known or hypothetical petroleum-potential formations and units, that is, sedimentary rocks and basins, and areas containing igneous and metamorphic rocks which have virtually little or no potential. The map was also compiled, in part, to provide a basis for outlining the geographic and petroleum provinces.

The maps are part of a worldwide series of maps on CD-ROM released by the U.S. Geological Survey's World Energy Project. The goal of the project is to assess the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the world. For data management purposes the world was divided into eight energy regions corresponding approximately to the economic regions of of the world as defined by the U.S. Department of State.

The depicted portion of Region 2 includes Turkey. Each region is divided into geologic provinces. Each province has a set of geologic characteristics that distinguish it from surrounding provinces. These characteristics may include the predominant lithologies, the age of the strata, and the structural style. Some provinces include multiple genetically-related basins. Geologic province boundaries are delineated using data from a number of geologic maps and other tectonic and geographic data (see References). Offshore province boundaries are defined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour. Each province is assigned a unique number. Because geologic trends are independent of political boundaries, some provinces overlap two regions. The code of those provinces that lie entirely within Europe begin with the number 4 and those provinces that lie entirely within Turkey begin with the number 2. The code of those provinces that lie partly within another region may start with a 1, for the Former Soviet Union (Persits and others 1998) or a 2, for Middle East and North Africa (Pollastro , 1998; Persits and others, 1997). The centerpoint locations of oil and gas fields are plotted based on the locations in the Petroconsultants International Data Corp. (1996) database with permission. Selected provinces are currently being investigated, by Total Petroleum System analysis, and assessments are being made of the undiscovered oil and gas resource potential of these provinces. Klett and others (1997) discuss the worldwide geologic provinces and their relative ranking in terms of total known petroleum volume. Specific details of the data sources and map compilation are given in the metadata files on this CD-ROM. Some stratigraphic units are combined to simplify the map and to ensure consistency across the region. All rocks are colored by age.

The images were taken before (April 16, 2018) and after (July 8, 2019) the sequence of earthquakes. Each color cycle represents 11.45 cm (4.5 inches) of ground displacement in the radar line-of-sight (LOS, 28 degrees from vertical and roughly east). The image covers an area of 50 by 125 kilometers (31 by 78 miles), and each pixel measures about 90 meters across. No filter was applied during the processing. The linear features that cut the color fringes in the southeast indicate likely locations of surface rupture caused by the earthquakes, and the noisy areas in the northwest may indicate locations where ground surface was disturbed by the earthquakes.Suggested Use:Each color cycle (ie. red to red) represents 4.5 inches of ground movement. The ground has moved more in areas where the color contour lines are closer together.

Commonly referred to as ""the Plafker map"", this publication is out of print and was used as baseline information for the creation of the Quaternary fault and fold database for Alaska (Koehler and others, 2012).<BR>The fault and fold database published by Koehler and others (2012) incorporates research carried out over the 20 years since publication of the original Plafker map and makes the results available in digital form. Koehler and others (2012) digitized Quaternary faults and folds from original sources at their original scales; their publication thus represents a more accurate depiction of the Quaternary traces shown on the Plafker map. Sheet 1 of Koehler and others (2012) includes the pre-Quaternary traces from the Plafker map as a background layer to show the distribution of faults throughout the state. To assist the user community and encourage more detailed mapping and paleoseismic research, we digitized the fault and fold traces from the Plafker map and made two vector shapefiles of these structures. These files are available for download. This package includes (1) a shapefile of all structures from the Plafker map, and (2) a shapefile of only pre-Quaternary structures. Ancillary features from the Plafker map that were not digitized include volcanic rocks, active thermal springs, bathymetric contours, focal regions and epicenters of major earthquakes, and depth contours of the Pacific Plate beneath the margin of southern Alaska. The scale of the Plafker map is 1:2,500,000, thus the data are not intended for depiction on large-scale maps. For the most accurate depiction of the locations of faults and folds in Alaska, users are referred to sheet 1 of Koehler and others (2012), which presents a combined dataset of the pre-Quaternary structures of the Plafker map and the Quaternary structures of Koehler and others (2012).",https://maps.dggs.alaska.gov/arcgis/rest/services/apps/mp150_prequaternary/MapServer/info/thumbnail,geology,8,geology
