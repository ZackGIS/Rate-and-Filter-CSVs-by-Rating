Some counties had black and white portions. Those files are named (countyname)bw.sid (.sdw). Some counties were all black and white, this is due to the photography. File sizes range from 1.5mb to 75mb. DOQQS's were developed from aerial photography taken during the Winters of 1995 and 1996 under US Geological Survey's (USGS) National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP). The NAPP photographs consist of 9 x 9 inch film images scaled at 1:40,000 with each photo centered over one of the four quarters (NE,NW,SW,SE) of a USGS 7.5 minute (1:24,000) topographic map. Four individual NAPP photos are required to completely cover the area of a USGS 7.5 minute topographic map.<BR><BR>To produce a DOQQ, the original 1:40,000 photography is reproduced as a 1:12,000 positive print which is scanned to produce a digital file with a ground resolution of 1 meter. These 1st order files are ortho-rectified and output as geotifs (over 150 MB each) referenced to UTM NAD83 coordinates.<BR><BR>The MARIS staff has mosaiced and projected the geotif files, in sets of four, to create output files in MSTM coordinates that correspond to USGS 7.5 1:24,000 topographic maps. These composite files are compressed using MrSID compression software. The files are stored by blocks designated by degrees of latitude and longitude(for example - 3390 identifies maps with a longitude of 33 degree and longitude of 90 degrees, etc.). Individual file names follow the USGS naming scheme (3390a1c.sid, 3089g3c.sid, etc.) MrSid desiginates the image file as a .sid file with an associated .sdw file as a world geo-reference file. The .sid file is binary while the .sdw file is ASCII. These files are not available in any other format or projection from the MARIS Technical Center. <BR><BR>",https://www.maris.state.ms.us/server/rest/services/Image/DOQQ_Quads/MapServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery

water/drill_areas,https://gis.dnr.mo.gov/arcgis/rest/services/water/drill_areas/MapServer,Map Service,"Missouri,Department of Natural Resources,EnergyAtlas,water","The purpose of the Water Well Drillers Act, section 256.600 to 256.640 Missouri Revised Statutes, and the regulations written to enforce this statute, is to establish standards that will protect Missouri's groundwater. The quality of groundwater in Missouri varies considerably across the state. Some areas have abundant, high quality groundwater while wells in other areas have natural highly mineralized or muddy water. In some areas of Missouri, pre-existing land use and other practices, such as waste disposal, have contaminated the aquifer. Because of the variability of groundwater quality in Missouri, these regulations can not guarantee that water produced from a properly constructed well will be of usable quality. The well construction regulations are designed to ensure that contamination from the surface is not entering the subsurface from an improperly constructed well. These regulations establish minimum specifications for well construction. In certain cases, more casing and grout may be necessary. Experienced permitted drillers and pump installers should be able to determine when more stringent construction will be necessary.",https://gis.dnr.mo.gov/arcgis/rest/services/water/drill_areas/MapServer/info/thumbnail,drilling areas for water,8,wells
