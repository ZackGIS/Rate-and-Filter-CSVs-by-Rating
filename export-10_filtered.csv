Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y). Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500- by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files.

Areas of interest were defined by the State. All aerial imagery was acquired using ADS direct digital sensors at an altitude sufficient for the production of digital orthophotos with a 1.0-foot or .5-foot pixel resolution as requested. Following acquisition of imagery data, survey ground control coordinates were used in-conjunction with Airborne GPS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) information to establish precise spatial positioning of the image data through the process of Analytical Aero-Triangulation (AT). Upon completion of AT, the imagery was rectified to the best available digital elevation model (DEM), whether from the USGS, other high quality DEM provided by the participating government in GeoTIFF or other compatible format, or new ADS stereo imagery compiled and edited surface model using Pictovera software. The resultant rectified imagery was analyzed and radiometrically adjusted to provide the state with optimal color and tonal appearance. Manually-placed seamlines were generated to mosaic imagery from adjacent flightlines. Following mosaicking and color-balancing, multiple QA/QC processes were performed to insure optimal data quality was achieved prior to tiling the data to 5,000 by 5,000 pixel extents. All ortho tiles were clipped to an AOI shapefile (buffered to 400-meters) boundaries, as supplied by the State of Michigan.

Easements are a common encumbrance but there are many others such as grazing rights, fishing rights, development rights, and floodplains. Legally an encumbrance is a right or interest in the land of another that may diminish its value but does not prevent its sale. Most encumbrances run with the land (consistent with the passing of the fee by conveyance). That is, they are tied to the land and will persist from owner to owner. Others exist at the pleasure of the owner, such as leases.

NLCD2006 is based primarily on the unsupervised classification of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) circa 2006 satellite data. NLCD2006 also quantifies land cover change between the years 2001 to 2006. The NLCD2006 land cover change product was generated by comparing spectral characteristics of Landsat imagery between 2001 and 2006, on an individual path/row basis, using protocols to identify and label change based on the trajectory from NLCD2001 products. It represents the first time this type of 30 meter resolution land cover change product has been produced for the conterminous United States. A formal accuracy assessment of the NLCD2006 land cover change product is planned for 2011. Generation of NLCD2006 products helped to identify some issues in the NLCD2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness products only (there were no changes to the NLCD2001 percent canopy). These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD2001 products (NLCD2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD2006 release. A majority of the NLCD2001 updates occurred in coastal mapping zones where NLCD2001 was published prior to the completion of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products. NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD2001 land cover for all coastal zones. NLCD2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality makes no warranties, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, completeness, currentness, reliability, or suitability for any particular purpose of the data contained here in.

It also represents the next iteration of the 2014 version increasing the previous number of glade polygons by 9,200 and the total acreage by over 23,500. Within the last four years, improved imagery and the expansion of mapping in several new counties resulted in these additions. The revised mapping and addition of more accurate geology shapefiles permitted the assignments of specific geologic units to the glade polygons. The American Bird Conservancy provided access to ArcMap to complete this project. The geo-dataset is designed to represent concise locations for the statewide distribution of MissouriÃ¢s principal glade-producing rock formations for dolomite, limestone, sandstone, igneous, shale and chert bedrock. The authors interpreted various imagery, geologic and topographic maps then conducted field surveys to validate mapping interpretations in various glade-producing landscapes. All of the glades can be readily cross-referenced to their respective natural community based on the delineation of the rock type incorporated into the geologic unit name.

The quality of groundwater in Missouri varies considerably across the state. Some areas have abundant, high quality groundwater while wells in other areas have natural highly mineralized or muddy water. In some areas of Missouri, pre-existing land use and other practices, such as waste disposal, have contaminated the aquifer. Because of the variability of groundwater quality in Missouri, these regulations can not guarantee that water produced from a properly constructed well will be of usable quality. The well construction regulations are designed to ensure that contamination from the surface is not entering the subsurface from an improperly constructed well. These regulations establish minimum specifications for well construction. In certain cases, more casing and grout may be necessary. Experienced permitted drillers and pump installers should be able to determine when more stringent construction will be necessary.",https://gis.dnr.mo.gov/arcgis/rest/services/water/drill_areas/MapServer/info/thumbnail,oil,8,wells

BLM_Surface_Ownership,https://services.arcgis.com/hOpd7wfnKm16p9D9/arcgis/rest/services/BLM_Surface_Ownership/FeatureServer,Feature Service,"New Mexico,New Mexico Department of Transportation,EnergyAtlas","This data was collected by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in New Mexico at both the New Mexico State Office and at the various field offices. This dataset is meant to depict the surface owner or manager of the land parcels. In the vast majority of land parcels, they will be one and the same. However, there are instances where the owner and manager of the land surface are not the same. When this occurs, the manager of the land is usually indicated. BLM's Master Title Plats are the official land records of the federal government and serve as the primary data source for depiction of all federal lands. Information from State of New Mexico is the primary source for the depiction of all state lands. Auxilliary source are referenced, as well, for the depiction of all lands. Collection of this dataset began in the 1980's using the BLM's ADS software to digitize information at the 1:24,000 scale. In the mid to late 1990's the data was converted from ADS to ArcInfo software and merged into tiles of one degree of longitude by one half degree of latitude. These tiles were regularly updated. The tiles were merged into a statewide coverage. The source geodatabase for this shapefile was created by loading the merged ArcInfo coverage into a personal geodatabase. The geodatabase data were snapped to a more accurate GCDB derived land network, where available. In areas where GCDB was not available the data were snapped to digitized PLSS. In 2006, the personal geodatabase was loaded into an enterprise geodatabase (SDE).
