Area 1 is the northeast zone and performed in 2017. Area 2 is the western zone and performed in 2018. Area 3 will be the central zone and performed in 2019. Area 4 will be the southeast zone and performed in 2020.<BR> The new 3-band orthoimagery will encompass the entire land area of the State of Ohio, or ~41,276 square miles. The tile border will be 1,000 feet beyond the state boundary with the following exceptions. The tile border with the states of Kentucky and West Virginia along the Ohio River shall be buffered a minimum distance of 1,000 feet or to the opposite river bank, whichever distance is greater. Border areas of the State proximate to Lake Erie, as well as islands, shall be buffered beyond the shoreline a minimum distance of 2,500 feet.<BR> Area 1 and Area2: The aerial imagery was collected during leaf-off conditions at a minimum resolution of 0.5-foot. The orthos are delivered as countywide datasets, consisting of 5,000' x 5,000' uncompressed 8-bit, 3-band color geotiff files. Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. Imagery was collected with VisionMap A3 Edge digital camera systems and rectified using existing LiDAR data. The file naming convention is as follows: nxxxxyyy (Ohio North Zone) and sxxxxyyy (Ohio South Zone); Please note that xxxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. The naming convention is based upon the previous OSIP project. Each geotiff ortho file is approximately 100 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with OGRIP and the state of Ohio.

It represents a mosaic of 414 digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQ) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The date of the orthophotography is 1990. The raster mosaic is based on DOQQs that are gray-scale, leaf-off, 1:12,000 scale (1 inch = 1,000 feet), quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) input raster images with 1-meter ground resolution. Input raster DOQQs are in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) format and named ""ortho_1990_quad0078se.tif"" after CT DEP quadrangle number 78, SE quadrant, for example. Each 7.5 minute quadrangle is broken into four quadrants: NE, NW, SE, and SW. Each of these 3.75 minute quarter quadrangles is referred to as a quarter quad.<BR> <BR>Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary orthophoto produced by the USGS is the digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ), a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255.",http://gis.cityofmiddletown.com:6080/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/Ortho_1990/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery
