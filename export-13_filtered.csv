It represents a mosaic of 414 digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQ) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The date of the orthophotography is 1990. The raster mosaic is based on DOQQs that are gray-scale, leaf-off, 1:12,000 scale (1 inch = 1,000 feet), quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) input raster images with 1-meter ground resolution. Input raster DOQQs are in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) format and named ""ortho_1990_quad0078se.tif"" after CT DEP quadrangle number 78, SE quadrant, for example. Each 7.5 minute quadrangle is broken into four quadrants: NE, NW, SE, and SW. Each of these 3.75 minute quarter quadrangles is referred to as a quarter quad.<BR> <BR>Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary orthophoto produced by the USGS is the digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ), a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255.",http://gis.cityofmiddletown.com:6080/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/Ortho_1990/ImageServer/info/thumbnail,imagery,8,imagery
